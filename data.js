[13/4/17, 20:27:11] Trina: ‎Messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted. No one outside of this chat, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them.
[13/4/17, 20:27:43] Yi Hein: Yeah
[13/4/17, 20:28:27] Yi Hein: Hmmm for me since I'm admin, I told them I'll help with pre-event planning
[13/4/17, 20:28:39] Yi Hein: Thanks for bringing this up
[13/4/17, 20:28:55] Yi Hein: I need to check with the others on their roles
[13/4/17, 20:29:01] Trina: Ohhhh no ok
‎[13/4/17, 20:29:56] Trina: ‎image omitted
[13/4/17, 20:30:01] Trina: Does this help!!
[13/4/17, 20:30:04] Yi Hein: Yes I just saw
[13/4/17, 20:30:11] Yi Hein: Ahhh it's a bummer
[13/4/17, 20:30:21] Yi Hein: Let me find a solution
[13/4/17, 20:30:32] Trina: Ya :-((((( ok thanks!!!!
[14/4/17, 21:39:10] Trina: Hey yi hein, so no changes to the date is it?
[15/4/17, 23:09:47] Yi Hein: Still looking at the final turnout before we make the decision
[23/6/17, 08:07:02] Trina: Hello yi hein, do you have the solution to the qn to sent to the grp?
[23/6/17, 12:00:24] Yi Hein: Not yet haha I kinda gave up
[23/6/17, 12:00:57] Yi Hein: Parth had an idea though
[23/6/17, 12:00:58] Trina: Bc I went to ask my tutor and he says it can't be done??
[23/6/17, 12:01:03] Trina: So idk if the qn is wrong
[23/6/17, 12:01:05] Yi Hein: Did you try you subbin n = r? I think you use this - if n is odd and divisible by 3, for example, then n+1 is even and n+ 3 is divisible by 3 again and so the individual factors in, say, 3!, can be divided by that n(n+1)... thing

[13/9/18, 15:50:16] Trina: ok this is paper 2 promos
[13/9/18, 15:51:16] Yi Hein: For lit y'all need to do comparison?
[13/9/18, 15:54:02] Trina: yup
[13/9/18, 15:54:40] Trina: i can't find anything gd from this yr lol my stuff r in shambles but if I find anything I'll send it to u
[13/9/18, 15:55:02] Yi Hein: Ah ok thanks so much
[13/9/18, 15:55:24] Yi Hein: What do you do the day before your lit exam?
[13/9/18, 15:55:33] Trina: its ok np
[13/9/18, 15:55:49] Trina: either read bks or quotes
[13/9/18, 15:56:06] Trina: if got time do some essay outlines.... just to check if u know what to write
[13/9/18, 15:56:47] Trina: there r qns that repeat a lot for lit (idk for ll) eg those on setting/sound
[13/9/18, 15:57:00] Yi Hein: Yeah same for LL
[13/9/18, 15:57:24] Trina: o then thats gd just memorise quotes haha
[13/9/18, 15:58:00] Yi Hein: What are the steps in your revision, like from knowing nothing (aka my current position) becoming Lord Trina
[13/9/18, 15:58:42] Trina: hahaha tbh by doing the notes/ compiling quotes you get q familiar w the text alr
[13/9/18, 15:59:09] Trina: come up w big headers (by theme or character) then start from the front and get quotes from every page to fill in
[13/9/18, 15:59:34] Trina: i prefer that over jumping across the text bc will tend to leave out details
[13/9/18, 16:00:14] Trina: if ok w quotes alr then do random stuff like read litcharts or some jstor stuff its helpful in helping u rmbr/phrase ideas btr
[13/9/18, 16:01:16] Trina: in the actual exam i think dont try to start scribbling immediately also its ok to take a bit longer to plan, once u have a clear outline of what to cover can write quite fast
[13/9/18, 16:01:25] Trina: thats probably it lah
[13/9/18, 16:02:02] Yi Hein: Ahh ok I shall start with compiling quotes, tmr I'm just going to pull sth random out of my ass 😭
[13/9/18, 16:02:25] Yi Hein: Also for choosing quotes do you have some kind of requirement like which quotes are better
[13/9/18, 16:02:44] Trina: me tbh but if rly no time at least pick out significant quotes in chapter (no need to sort) and just memorise
[13/9/18, 16:02:55] Trina: u can use them in however manner fits in the paper tmr
[13/9/18, 16:03:42] Trina: hm idk leh?? dont choose those that are too general? btr if they help u to address a theme/ make a point about a character
[13/9/18, 16:04:25] Yi Hein: Alright thanks so much, ok at least now I know what I need to do haha
[13/9/18, 16:04:35] Trina: oki atb!
[13/9/18, 16:05:19] Yi Hein: Atb! Defend your throne has lit TOP haha
[13/9/18, 16:05:57] Trina: hhahahah i try.,,,,, not looking too gd for me aft p1 but is ok..,,thank u

[9/10/18, 21:11:39] Yi Hein: Hey trina, here's my Gatsby notes, help me see where to cut down thanks!
[9/10/18, 22:21:31] Trina: kk I'll look at it asap!
[16/10/18, 17:45:17] Yi Hein: Hey trina, normally what would be considered as significant in a novel? Like what's the criteria
[16/10/18, 17:58:55] Trina: what u mean? event wise?
[16/10/18, 18:22:59] Yi Hein: when a question has the word "significant", yeah like significant events/incidence
[16/10/18, 18:25:36] Trina: i think its up to you to decide, but it has to contribute to developing sth,, either to drive the plot or to explore a theme
[16/10/18, 18:26:10] Trina: have eg??
[16/10/18, 18:27:01] Yi Hein: not with me now, but I'll ask when I get round to doing essays
[16/10/18, 18:27:08] Yi Hein: This works for now
[16/10/18, 18:27:16] Trina: oki
[16/10/18, 18:27:31] Trina: rmbr if significant event must state what it is in intro
[16/10/18, 18:27:41] Trina: or if they ask climax must STATE
[16/10/18, 19:27:24] Yi Hein: Omg how do you memorise sooo many quotes, Im 5% in memorising and I'm starting to forget already 😫
[16/10/18, 19:27:49] Trina: hahahahhah JY!!!!!!!!!!!

[17/10/18, 00:23:16] Yi Hein: Took me 2 hours to _type_ an essay though, feeling like my notes are insufficient, but it's already 20k words :/
[17/10/18, 00:23:46] Trina: hhhahhahahah nice
[17/10/18, 00:23:59] Trina: 20k is insane pls
[17/10/18, 00:24:33] Yi Hein: Both books combined
‎[17/10/18, 00:25:00] Trina: ‎image omitted
[17/10/18, 00:25:18] Yi Hein: Hahaha that's from like O levels I think
[17/10/18, 00:26:03] Trina: kk atb m gna sleep BYE
[27/10/18, 21:32:31] Yi Hein: Hey trina what are the different things I've to analyse from the book?

So far I've got,
Themes
Characterisation
Narrative POV and Voice
Symbols
Foreshadowing
Conflict
Tension
Atmosphere
Motifs
[27/10/18, 21:32:58] Yi Hein: I realised May 18 they test genre and I'm like wuutttttt
[27/10/18, 21:33:16] Yi Hein: So is there anything that you feel is impt and I missed out?
[27/10/18, 21:39:22] Trina: hello did u include setting
[27/10/18, 21:39:22] Trina: n character roles n relations
[27/10/18, 21:41:19] Trina: ok i went to see the genre qn and it is indeed quite weird.. idk what to say abt prose as a genre
[27/10/18, 21:43:59] Yi Hein: Oh yeah did include
[27/10/18, 21:44:18] Yi Hein: Oh ok I prob need to polish this up a bit.. but there are quite a lot of permutations
[27/10/18, 21:44:34] Trina: do the main character to other characters
[27/10/18, 21:44:36] Trina: more impt
[27/10/18, 21:44:54] Trina: or btn characters that u can draw parallels w
[27/10/18, 21:45:32] Yi Hein: Ooooh ok nice, yeah I can see how it's relevant haha
[27/10/18, 21:45:42] Yi Hein: Hmmm other than this are there anything else?
[27/10/18, 21:46:12] Trina: hm
[27/10/18, 21:46:21] Trina: how abt bk structure
[27/10/18, 21:46:28] Trina: in terms of how chapters are spaced n stuff?
[27/10/18, 21:46:38] Trina: like does the narration speed up/ slow down at certain pts
[27/10/18, 21:47:30] Yi Hein: But what kind of points can I even make rgding structure?
[27/10/18, 21:48:00] Trina: ok bc my lit qn was sth like "In the work of at least two playwrights you have studied, compare how structural elements (for example, acts, scenes, transitions, revelations) contribute to our understanding of the central themes of the play."
[27/10/18, 21:48:00] Trina: idk if u all might have tho
[27/10/18, 21:48:04] Trina: since its a novel
[27/10/18, 21:48:30] Yi Hein: Wutttt do you have an essay
[27/10/18, 21:48:52] Trina: NO cru
[27/10/18, 21:48:52] Trina: cri
[27/10/18, 21:49:00] Trina: but i honestly think novel probably not
[27/10/18, 21:49:13] Trina: but IDK hahahaha
[27/10/18, 21:49:16] Yi Hein: Dammit I'm got a weird feeling this might come out just to screw me over
[27/10/18, 21:49:41] Trina: jus DONT DO
[27/10/18, 21:49:41] Trina: hhhaha
[27/10/18, 21:50:26] Yi Hein: Some years can only do 1 qns 😭 and apparently context questions are deceptive traps
[27/10/18, 21:50:53] Yi Hein: I'll prob do up some rough notes abt structure
[27/10/18, 21:50:56] Trina: is hard to have a qn about this for novel i think
[27/10/18, 21:51:06] Trina: bc what are the conventions for prose
[27/10/18, 21:51:07] Trina: honestly
[27/10/18, 21:51:47] Yi Hein: May 18 also tested "form and content" of the works you've studied
[27/10/18, 21:52:05] Yi Hein: Form can consist of structure I Guess?
[27/10/18, 21:52:17] Trina: so another conventions/structure qn????
[27/10/18, 21:52:17] Trina: WOW ok
[27/10/18, 21:52:40] Trina: cri but literary conventions are under the markscheme right
[27/10/18, 21:52:54] Trina: try to find out abt specific prose conventions
[27/10/18, 21:52:58] Yi Hein: Yeah analysis of stylistic devices
[27/10/18, 21:53:05] Trina: is gatsby/outsider regarded as tragedies
[27/10/18, 21:53:09] Trina: u can also find out abt that
[27/10/18, 21:53:16] Yi Hein: Ohhhh oh
[27/10/18, 21:53:51] Yi Hein: Ok so I gotta do some research on conventions
[27/10/18, 21:54:06] Yi Hein: So conventions should apply to structure and genre right
[27/10/18, 21:54:25] Trina: i guess yes
[27/10/18, 21:54:40] Trina: GD LUCK
[27/10/18, 21:55:05] Yi Hein: Wait what's classification is this under
[27/10/18, 21:55:19] Yi Hein: It's not genre right
[27/10/18, 21:55:42] Trina: no meh
[27/10/18, 21:55:42] Trina: let me check
[27/10/18, 21:56:36] Trina: https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/genre/
[27/10/18, 21:56:43] Trina: back to the most reliable website hahahha
[27/10/18, 21:56:59] Yi Hein: HAHAHHAAH omg nice
[27/10/18, 21:57:18] Yi Hein: Whoops
[27/10/18, 21:58:00] Yi Hein: Btw when there is a essay on structure for example, how do you even analyse stylistic devices? Cosnits in the mark scheme
[27/10/18, 21:59:14] Trina: hmm on structure? as in the genre one or what
[27/10/18, 22:00:02] Yi Hein: Hmmm more of structure of the prose? Like if it's like a very macro-question
[27/10/18, 22:00:59] Trina: i hav no idea
[27/10/18, 22:01:11] Trina: how to ask?
[27/10/18, 22:02:31] Yi Hein: I mean like some qns like on narrative voice, it's also kinda difficult to analyse literary devices
[27/10/18, 22:03:12] Trina: do u have an eg bc idgi 😖
‎[27/10/18, 22:04:47] Yi Hein: ‎image omitted
[27/10/18, 22:04:47] Trina: just before i forget those qns that ask abt how genre CONTRIBUTES TO MEANING OF NOVEL it is very easy to get carried away talking abt the conventions n forgetting to link back to the CONTRIBUTING TO MEANING part
[27/10/18, 22:04:55] Trina: so must b careful
[27/10/18, 22:05:08] Yi Hein: Ok so how do you link it
[27/10/18, 22:06:17] Yi Hein: What consititutes meaning
[27/10/18, 22:06:33] Trina: ok if u want to say the genre is "realist prose" then u must say it is REALIST bc they refer to stuff that are modern at that time eg .. (IDK references to cultural icons/music of that decade or whatever) therefore readers can connect to characters or sth then themes of am dream are more compelling/memorable
[27/10/18, 22:07:07] Yi Hein: Wait so it's reader's response!
[27/10/18, 22:07:09] Yi Hein: *?
[27/10/18, 22:07:16] Trina: themes or whatever
[27/10/18, 22:07:46] Yi Hein: Ooooh ok, so meaning = ideas / themes conveyed in the text
[27/10/18, 22:07:53] Trina: depends on qn but usually yes,, bc talking abt themes naturally shd talk abt msg to reader
[27/10/18, 22:08:09] Trina: yep
[27/10/18, 22:08:51] Trina: ok the narrative voice thing.. is weird.. what is an intellectual concern man
[27/10/18, 22:09:09] Yi Hein: Oh it's for 'the outsider'
[27/10/18, 22:09:27] Yi Hein: It's relevant to the second novel
[27/10/18, 22:10:16] Trina: wrt social standing,, ok i guess you cld talk abt 1. who is the narrator (1st person right) -> how does this allow the narrator to maybe witness certain events n convey them to the audience or sth
‎[27/10/18, 22:10:25] Yi Hein: ‎image omitted
[27/10/18, 22:10:46] Trina: HHhhhh ok this is strange to me bc i know nothing abt the outsider
[27/10/18, 22:11:02] Trina: but use characterisation instead lah since its either or
[27/10/18, 22:11:20] Yi Hein: Wait so I don't have to add in like use of "metaphor, simile, all diff types of imagery" in my essay to score for thieving
[27/10/18, 22:11:24] Yi Hein: *this
[27/10/18, 22:11:37] Trina: narrative voice i find hard to do leh.. unless it is very distinct like in virginia woolf that kind of writer
[27/10/18, 22:12:23] Yi Hein: As uncultured as I am, I'm assuming that's a good book
[27/10/18, 22:13:23] Yi Hein: Analysing narrative voice counts to criterion C?
[27/10/18, 22:13:24] Trina: i think most qns u can somehow include leh
[27/10/18, 22:13:37] Trina: i mean even talking abt 1st person narrator comes under narrative voice alr
[27/10/18, 22:14:30] Yi Hein: Ahh ok I see
[27/10/18, 22:15:21] Yi Hein: Ok I'll see how it works out on Friday, thanks for spending the time to answer

[1/11/18, 19:37:37] Yi Hein: *dialogur
[1/11/18, 19:42:40] Trina: if dialogue specific qns u need to quote extensively definitely
[1/11/18, 19:42:51] Trina: maybe can link to conflict -> tension
[1/11/18, 19:43:12] Trina: or dramatic irony,, stuff that through the dialogue only the readers understand...
[1/11/18, 19:43:34] Trina: or stuff like symbols that the characters use that readers will get
[1/11/18, 19:44:25] Trina: dialogue can also help in characterisation/ theme development
[1/11/18, 19:44:55] Trina: tbh can use for many things even foreshadowing n stuff,, see whichever applies i think its quite flexible
[1/11/18, 20:27:44] Yi Hein: Ahh ok, I'm prob not going to do it but I'll have this just in case
[1/11/18, 20:27:57] Yi Hein: Super scared IB is going to checkmate me tomorrow

[1/11/18, 20:29:39] Yi Hein: That being said RNG hasn't good though, got a freaking comic for P1, Econs they tested the most obscure parts

[4/12/18, 14:37:19] Trina: 30 min reading time for the judgement of a case
[4/12/18, 14:37:32] Trina: (damn complicated didn't rly get it) on environmental law
[4/12/18, 14:37:42] Trina: Then they asked abt the case
[4/12/18, 14:39:16] Yi Hein: Which part tripped you up
[4/12/18, 14:39:34] Trina: The whole thing was v hard to understand
[4/12/18, 14:39:43] Trina: Found the language v convoluted
[4/12/18, 14:40:24] Trina: During the prep I was expecting more general qns that spring from the case but no they asked very specific qns on the case itself
[4/12/18, 14:40:38] Trina: Like the case was not a springboard it was the thing they discussed specifically
[4/12/18, 15:10:02] Yi Hein: What do you mean by springboard
[4/12/18, 15:11:40] Trina: They didn't use the case as the basis for asking more general qns
[4/12/18, 15:56:26] Yi Hein: Are you free to Skype abt it?
[4/12/18, 16:00:00] Trina: Not now haha sry
[4/12/18, 16:00:11] Trina: Hav internship starting alr
[4/12/18, 16:51:54] Yi Hein: 9-10pm?

[4/12/18, 16:52:39] Trina: Just WA is ok! I reply u when I can hahaha
[4/12/18, 16:52:48] Yi Hein: 👌🏼
[4/12/18, 17:08:30] Yi Hein: *Questions*
1. Can you run me through the entire process, as detailed as possible, before the interview, during the reading time, and the actual interview itself, including the thought processes at each point? (Maybe like prose format? like I wanna get a very clear and detailed idea what the entire experience was)

2. What did you expect from the interview, what was different, and how did you react/adapt to it? What was your thought process throughout 

2.a) was what you expected from the interview from information by the seniors? 

3. What was the feel of the interview like? Was it chill, conversational or intense? What's your overall impression for the interview and the interviewer 

4. What did you study when preparing for the interview, and did it help you?

5. What do you think you did well for the interview?

6. What do you think you think you screwed up on and how would you have done differently?

7. Any general advice from your experience

8. Did they ask any questions about you? Or about personal statement?

9. Can you give an example of a question they asked, your answer to the question, and their reaction, and the follow up question after your answer?
[4/12/18, 17:08:40] Yi Hein: ^ ok this is it for now
[4/12/18, 17:33:47] Trina: WOWOW ok I reply u asap
[4/12/18, 17:45:46] Trina: 1. Ok the administrator sits u in a com lab rm, passes u the reading material for whatever time required (mine was 30min). Was reading/annotating but there was no explicit instructions at all about what I was supposed to do w it (so no guiding qns whatever..,, just read). The passage was v hard to understand for me bc there was q a lot of legal jargon??? Then they call you into a room where they will make the skype call for u
2. Bc the passage was on env law I was thinking they would ask about individual freedom vs general interest (in this case env protection) but instead they went v in depth into the case details itself. So they asked for why the judge came to such a decision, how he did so, was it justified, how it was important as an example for future cases, what happens when they change a fact abt the case etc. basically my thoughts were: IM DYING. Didn't ask seniors
3. Interviewers were very smart and very nice. Very smiley also, but they are definitely very sharp.., so you can't bluff your way through lol. They asked me abt the thought process behind the decision then I said some stuff and they were like "is that a outcome or a reason;-)))))))" 
4. Studied legal terms, sg legal system. NVR EVEN HELP ME. CANNOT B SAVED
5. NOTHING I was dying 
6. EVERYTHING but I think i shd have read the case more in depth haha but tbh that was the best I could do at understanding it in 30min
7. Errrrr don't think u can prep much (as far as law is concerned). Read up on ur tutor's specializations? May not help tho. I know my tutor was some env lawyer
8. 1st qn only as icebreaker they probs don't care abt yr ans
9. See above^^^ but they just nod n continue probing. They literally have no mercy lol if u r struggling they don't drop it they will KEEP ASKING
[4/12/18, 17:48:19] Yi Hein: You had a tutor for law?
[4/12/18, 17:58:24] Trina: Ya if u do skype
[4/12/18, 17:58:36] Trina: They will give u the tutors for that subject of that college
[4/12/18, 17:58:53] Trina: The ppl who will teach u if u get in
[4/12/18, 18:04:59] Yi Hein: So the tutors would teach you before the interview?
[4/12/18, 18:05:22] Yi Hein: Oh wait the tutor interviews you issit?
[4/12/18, 18:47:51] Trina: Yep
[4/12/18, 18:48:17] Yi Hein: What's the runtime between knowing your tutor and the interview date
[4/12/18, 18:48:53] Trina: as long as u know what college u r allocated to for interview
[4/12/18, 18:48:56] Trina: U can google
[4/12/18, 18:49:05] Trina: At each college there's only 1-2 tutors per subject
[4/12/18, 18:49:15] Yi Hein: Ohhh I see ok
[4/12/18, 18:49:33] Yi Hein: From ppl I heard this year it's all really rough
[4/12/18, 18:49:41] Trina: I RLY DIED rly rly
[4/12/18, 18:49:52] Trina: I alr accept my rejection
[4/12/18, 18:49:56] Trina: Alr at final stage of grief
[4/12/18, 18:50:07] Yi Hein: Woah that was fast

[4/12/18, 18:51:10] Trina: no scholarship cannot even talk lol it's NUS ALR
[4/12/18, 18:51:19] Yi Hein: Loan?
[4/12/18, 18:51:23] Trina: DW
[4/12/18, 18:51:29] Yi Hein: Why though
[4/12/18, 18:51:45] Yi Hein: Education last for a lifetime, a loan lasts 10 years?
[4/12/18, 18:51:48] Trina: UCL is not that much better than NUS to warrant that
[4/12/18, 18:51:53] Trina: And it's soooo much more
[4/12/18, 18:52:03] Trina: If it's oxford AH that's another qn completely
[4/12/18, 18:52:11] Yi Hein: Ohhh ok but UCL TOP 10 right?
[4/12/18, 18:52:26] Trina: Ya but I don't think it's worth so much more $
[4/12/18, 18:52:32] Trina: Nus is 11 iirc
[4/12/18, 18:52:40] Yi Hein: Woahh that's good

[4/12/18, 18:53:57] Trina: NUS is gd enough
[4/12/18, 18:54:16] Yi Hein: Don't really trust NUS tho hahaha
[4/12/18, 18:54:28] Trina: It's vvvvv gd alr I think
[4/12/18, 18:54:32] Yi Hein: Can't get loan either cos I wanna start a company in the future

[9/12/18, 20:58:43] Yi Hein: I think you have to be good friends with your mentor first, then they'll care about you and your learning/growth
[9/12/18, 20:59:08] Yi Hein: Then learning opportunities would come by easier I think

[30/1/19, 16:32:27] Yi Hein: I talked about science competitions and research experience for the more academic stuff
[30/1/19, 16:32:40] Yi Hein: Didn't talk about school acads cos not enough words
[30/1/19, 16:34:08] Yi Hein: I talked about what I learnt from each CCA and how it relates and is useful in medical context
[30/1/19, 16:35:12] Yi Hein: I suck at telling stories, really cringey hahahaha maybe I should read more
[30/1/19, 16:35:26] Trina: HHHHHH JDJDBDH
[30/1/19, 16:36:00] Trina: Bc I'm in a crisis
[30/1/19, 16:36:12] Trina: I want to tell stories but with telling stories u need to narrate
[30/1/19, 16:36:17] Trina: WHICH WASTES WORDS
[30/1/19, 16:36:53] Yi Hein: Hmmm I'm gonna tell one to start of PS
[30/1/19, 16:37:07] Yi Hein: To capture attention? Idek but I'm horrible at that too hahaha
[30/1/19, 16:37:19] Trina: Argehdgg
[30/1/19, 16:37:33] Trina: I don't have much sci things outside sch to say also
[30/1/19, 16:37:51] Trina: Actually I wanted to angle my PS as how arts is impt in med
[30/1/19, 16:37:56] Trina: But I think they won't like
[30/1/19, 16:38:17] Trina: I don't have enough words la zzzzzzz I try again later
[30/1/19, 16:38:18] Trina: Thz
[30/1/19, 16:38:43] Yi Hein: Okk I'm rewriting mine too :////:/
[30/1/19, 16:38:49] Trina: What why!!!!
[30/1/19, 16:39:09] Yi Hein: Mine very disjointed like listing stuff
[30/1/19, 16:39:29] Trina: Bc this one is not like UK rigjt
[30/1/19, 16:39:37] Trina: UK don't have a place to list achievements
[30/1/19, 16:39:43] Trina: I think u don't need to focus on acads
[30/1/19, 16:39:48] Trina: The qn is on experiences
[30/1/19, 16:39:59] Trina: So those stuff that u need to list I think can just put under CCA
[30/1/19, 16:40:06] Yi Hein: That'll actually make you stand out, so tbh not a lot of sci combi ppl are good in arts
[30/1/19, 16:40:29] Trina: That's what I thought??.,, like it gives me something different to offer
[30/1/19, 16:40:38] Trina: But it's damn weird to focus a med essay on arts right
[30/1/19, 16:40:46] Trina: AIYA I'll find a way
[30/1/19, 16:40:53] Trina: Then u help me read lololol
[30/1/19, 16:41:40] Yi Hein: Yeah from what I heard don't need to put any achievements, it's more on yourself as a person, your experiences and what you've learnt
[30/1/19, 16:42:15] Trina: YEH
[30/1/19, 16:42:17] Yi Hein: Well that's why it'll be amazing if you can do it
[30/1/19, 16:42:25] Trina: OK I try
[30/1/19, 16:42:40] Trina: What you gonna do if u get in ah

[30/1/19, 16:43:10] Yi Hein: My original plan is to continue NS cos they hold my place
[30/1/19, 16:43:15] Yi Hein: And apply U.K. In the process
[30/1/19, 16:43:43] Yi Hein: But depends on my NS posting, if I get a crap vocation then I might disrupt NS
[30/1/19, 16:43:53] Trina: Hahahah
[30/1/19, 16:44:02] Trina: So if they hold your place
[30/1/19, 16:44:09] Trina: You can reject them in 1 year meh
[30/1/19, 16:44:15] Trina: If you get a place in UK

[30/1/19, 16:53:35] Yi Hein: Can, but I would want to stay for the leadership training
[30/1/19, 16:53:42] Trina: If you defer you 1. Cannot apply U.K. 2. Cannot serve your bond in army right
[30/1/19, 16:54:20] Trina: Ok la I think that's q a wise choice

[30/1/19, 16:55:25] Yi Hein: Yeah but Long term, not deferring would be better
[30/1/19, 16:55:40] Yi Hein: Once I start business can't afford to fail so I gotta pick up all the skills now

[3/2/19, 15:17:36] Yi Hein: I don't really have a chronological sequence of experiences so kinda at a lost on how to organise
[3/2/19, 15:17:51] Trina: hm
[3/2/19, 15:18:30] Trina: Any way u can switch up the formatting
[3/2/19, 15:18:53] Trina: Very rigid now
[3/2/19, 15:21:16] Yi Hein: Ok I try to rewrite some parts
[3/2/19, 15:21:57] Yi Hein: I think I generally think very rigidly? Idek
[3/2/19, 15:22:16] Yi Hein: Azmi has been telling me to stop doing that for 2 years hahaha
[3/2/19, 15:22:17] Trina: M so sorry I don't have anything explicit to change for u :(

[3/2/19, 15:23:47] Trina: Not a checklist
[3/2/19, 15:24:05] Trina: U know how the referee needs to fill in a questionnaire of sorts
[3/2/19, 15:24:22] Yi Hein: Do you know where to find it?
‎[3/2/19, 15:24:49] Trina: ‎image omitted
‎[3/2/19, 15:24:50] Trina: ‎image omitted
‎[3/2/19, 15:25:03] Trina: ‎image omitted
[3/2/19, 15:25:14] Trina: This part seems like where u are trying to check off 😖
[3/2/19, 15:25:19] Yi Hein: Omg yeah
[3/2/19, 15:25:25] Trina: RIGHT
[3/2/19, 15:25:33] Trina: IN ORDER SOME MORE
[3/2/19, 15:25:38] Trina: 😫😫😫
[3/2/19, 15:26:11] Yi Hein: I didnt even realise...
[3/2/19, 15:26:50] Yi Hein: Was spamming things they mentioned in the talks I've went, so I Guess that's why
[3/2/19, 15:27:09] Trina: AHHH I thought u were following this list
[3/2/19, 15:27:15] Yi Hein: Is this on NUS website
[3/2/19, 15:27:19] Trina: Yes
[3/2/19, 15:27:33] Yi Hein: What did you Google
[3/2/19, 15:27:40] Trina: https://itumed.nus.edu.sg/ram/document/RefereeReportSample.pdf
[3/2/19, 15:27:51] Trina: ^ the link
[3/2/19, 15:28:22] Yi Hein: Thankssssss
[3/2/19, 15:28:30] Yi Hein: Are there any other documents available on the site
[3/2/19, 15:28:39] Trina: Nah the rest don't look that impt
[3/2/19, 15:30:23] Yi Hein: Btw was the journey you outlined in your PS really what got you interested in Med?
[3/2/19, 15:30:31] Trina: Quite accurate
[3/2/19, 15:30:35] Trina: STORIES ARE ALL REAL
[3/2/19, 15:30:38] Trina: It's how u link it
[3/2/19, 15:30:56] Trina: It's easier to remember separate stories if u weave them into your own narrative I think
[3/2/19, 15:31:22] Yi Hein: hmmm what do you mean?
[3/2/19, 15:31:43] Trina: Ok personally
[3/2/19, 15:31:46] Trina: My own PS
[3/2/19, 15:31:59] Trina: I wanted to write a narrative about me fixing things as my baseline
[3/2/19, 15:32:13] Trina: Then the events that follow are very separate but I connect them by this common thread
[3/2/19, 15:32:39] Yi Hein: Ohhh I see
[3/2/19, 15:33:27] Yi Hein: Really unique to think abt fixing things
[3/2/19, 15:33:44] Trina: OK I think I know how to put it
[3/2/19, 15:33:49] Trina: Yours reads a lot like a report
[3/2/19, 15:33:53] Trina: Of what things u did
[3/2/19, 15:33:56] Trina: Not a personal story
[3/2/19, 15:34:05] Trina: Does that make sense
[3/2/19, 15:34:17] Yi Hein: Yeah I agree
[3/2/19, 15:34:31] Trina: Hm
[3/2/19, 15:34:37] Trina: Your main motivation is what
[3/2/19, 15:34:41] Trina: For doing medicine
[3/2/19, 15:34:55] Trina: Sci and helping ppl?
[3/2/19, 15:37:03] Yi Hein: Sort of in a sense..to make an impact on their lives, like u know when you're really sick and feel incredibly horrible, but then next day you recover and it feels like u are revived
[3/2/19, 15:37:39] Yi Hein: not sure if that's the right way to put it
[3/2/19, 15:37:48] Trina: Hm
[3/2/19, 15:37:48] Trina: Ok
[3/2/19, 15:37:53] Trina: I try to think abt it
[3/2/19, 15:38:15] Trina: I'll tell you if I think of anything hahahah
[3/2/19, 15:38:41] Yi Hein: do u know what does a letter of introduction mean?
[3/2/19, 15:38:50] Yi Hein: like follow letter conventions?
[3/2/19, 15:38:57] Trina: What
[3/2/19, 15:39:04] Trina: U mean for this application ah
[3/2/19, 15:39:06] Trina: No leh
[3/2/19, 15:39:19] Yi Hein: Yeah
[3/2/19, 15:39:34] Trina: No need I think ur structure is fine
‎[3/2/19, 15:39:40] Yi Hein: ‎image omitted
[3/2/19, 15:39:54] Trina: HONESTLY ur essay is OK
[3/2/19, 15:40:02] Trina: But it doesn't stand out
[3/2/19, 15:40:13] Trina: WHICH IS A PROBLEM!!!!! Bc u shd
[3/2/19, 15:41:43] Yi Hein: Yeah I get what you mean
[3/2/19, 15:42:14] Yi Hein: I'll think abt it hopefully something comes to me
[3/2/19, 15:42:24] Trina: 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
[3/2/19, 15:53:58] Yi Hein: To be honest, to more I think, the more I don't know what my main motivation is
[3/2/19, 15:55:15] Yi Hein: I just wanna dedicate my life to serving others, that's about it
[3/2/19, 15:55:59] Yi Hein: I'm pretty good in science
[3/2/19, 15:56:11] Yi Hein: And Med has a lot science so it kinda fits?
[3/2/19, 15:56:41] Trina: Ya it was the same for me
[3/2/19, 15:56:54] Trina: The usual reasons why people want to do med are usually,,, invalid
[3/2/19, 15:57:06] Trina: And maybe unrealistic for jaded doctors
[3/2/19, 15:57:32] Yi Hein: what usual reasons?
[3/2/19, 15:57:47] Trina: Helping ppl is a common one that I also used
[3/2/19, 15:58:02] Trina: But the thing is doctors irl don't really feel like they are doing much right
[3/2/19, 15:58:13] Trina: And there's much less direct contact with patients than expected
[3/2/19, 15:58:19] Yi Hein: Hmmm why not?
[3/2/19, 15:58:43] Trina: During the attachments did u also feel that the doctors r not truly the ones making the most direct impact on patients
[3/2/19, 15:58:51] Trina: They do the diagnosis and the meds
[3/2/19, 15:59:04] Trina: But after that the execution is the nurses/pt/ot etc
[3/2/19, 15:59:52] Yi Hein: I was following residency student so she was on the pc most of the time lol
[3/2/19, 15:59:56] Yi Hein: Who did you follow
[3/2/19, 15:59:56] Trina: YES
[3/2/19, 16:00:12] Trina: M3, M5
[3/2/19, 16:00:22] Yi Hein: Medical students?

[3/2/19, 16:00:38] Trina: A LOT of clerking right
[3/2/19, 16:00:47] Trina: BC THE MAIN DOC WAS TRYING TO GET RID OF ME!!!!!
[3/2/19, 16:00:54] Trina: And a doctor doing clinics
[3/2/19, 16:00:57] Yi Hein: Lololololol
[3/2/19, 16:01:11] Yi Hein: The main for me wasn't even in singapore
[3/2/19, 16:01:13] Trina: I think u know her son
[3/2/19, 16:01:21] Yi Hein: Hmmm?
[3/2/19, 16:01:20] Trina: Hahhaahahah
[3/2/19, 16:01:29] Trina: Daniel from track I think
[3/2/19, 16:01:36] Yi Hein: OMG WHAT
[3/2/19, 16:01:38] Trina: It was STRANGE
[3/2/19, 16:01:40] Trina: YAAA
[3/2/19, 16:01:48] Trina: HECKIN WEIRD
[3/2/19, 16:01:55] Yi Hein: She's a legendary doctor from what I heard
[3/2/19, 16:02:02] Trina: knowing that's someone u know by proxy
[3/2/19, 16:02:06] Trina: She is fantastic.,,
[3/2/19, 16:02:14] Yi Hein: Hahaha she told you abt Daniel?
[3/2/19, 16:02:22] Trina: She said her son is from ACS
[3/2/19, 16:02:28] Trina: Same batch
[3/2/19, 16:02:31] Trina: So I asked who lah
[3/2/19, 16:02:33] Trina: Hahahahah
[3/2/19, 16:02:55] Yi Hein: Ohhh he's also really amazing guy
[3/2/19, 16:02:59] Yi Hein: Ran with him for 6 years
[3/2/19, 16:03:06] Trina: Hahhaah
[3/2/19, 16:03:27] Trina: Even a quite senior surgeon is pretty jaded by healthcare
[3/2/19, 16:03:35] Trina: Says he feels like he's not doing anything to help
[3/2/19, 16:03:47] Yi Hein: Huh legit
[3/2/19, 16:03:52] Yi Hein: Why does he say that
[3/2/19, 16:03:53] Trina: Ye
[3/2/19, 16:04:16] Trina: Aside from the job being not financially rewarding
[3/2/19, 16:04:20] Yi Hein: He's literally cutting people to save them
[3/2/19, 16:04:21] Trina: U get scolded a LOT
[3/2/19, 16:04:32] Trina: Ppl are angry and want to sue u everyday
[3/2/19, 16:04:40] Trina: IE lose faith in humanity LOLOL
[3/2/19, 16:04:49] Yi Hein: Ohhh I see
[3/2/19, 16:05:08] Yi Hein: Yeah that's the reason why Doctors are on pc all the time
[3/2/19, 16:05:25] Yi Hein: Documenting everything in case got lawsuit
[3/2/19, 16:05:36] Trina: As such they hardly talk to patients
[3/2/19, 16:05:54] Trina: A lot of admin
[3/2/19, 16:06:03] Trina: Esp in first few years
[3/2/19, 16:06:06] Trina: No life
[3/2/19, 16:06:11] Trina: 2.9k pay
[3/2/19, 16:06:19] Trina: Work weekends
[3/2/19, 16:06:41] Yi Hein: The senior consultant I was following really loved her patients tho can really see her love for patients and compassion towards each of them...even tho they were so rude to her and said bad things about her
[3/2/19, 16:07:11] Trina: It's a v difficult path
[3/2/19, 16:07:21] Trina: Often little rewards
[3/2/19, 16:07:50] Trina: Need to find out what keeps u going when things suck
[3/2/19, 16:08:08] Trina: N SAY IT IN UR PS!!
[3/2/19, 16:09:03] Yi Hein: But a bit hard to know what I'll think until I'm in that position though
[3/2/19, 16:09:12] Trina: Must b ready to give up many things
[3/2/19, 16:09:23] Trina: Free time, time for family etc
[3/2/19, 16:09:42] Trina: Ya sadly :(((
[3/2/19, 16:10:28] Yi Hein: Also it's like 20 years until like gets better
[3/2/19, 16:10:33] Yi Hein: *life
[3/2/19, 16:10:40] Trina: Ya :/
[3/2/19, 16:10:46] Yi Hein: So around 40 lol
[3/2/19, 16:11:08] Trina: I haven't met even 1 doctor who said do med
[3/2/19, 16:11:18] Yi Hein: Really?
[3/2/19, 16:11:28] Trina: Ya.. and at all stages
[3/2/19, 16:11:31] Yi Hein: My experience was quite different
[3/2/19, 16:11:39] Trina: Students to HOs to MOs to consultants LOLOL
[3/2/19, 16:11:43] Trina: They said to do it?
[3/2/19, 16:12:22] Yi Hein: After 30 hours on-call she said if you are really passionate about it, go for it, but I must be willing to make the sacrifices
[3/2/19, 16:12:48] Trina: U followed her on call?
[3/2/19, 16:12:49] Trina: WOWOW
[3/2/19, 16:12:59] Yi Hein: No lah parents didn't allow
[3/2/19, 16:13:05] Trina: Hahahhah
[3/2/19, 16:13:07] Yi Hein: Only stayed till 10
[3/2/19, 16:13:29] Trina: Ya quite diff experiences lololol
[3/2/19, 16:13:43] Trina: But I think it was a v realistic picture of med in sg
[3/2/19, 16:13:49] Yi Hein: What else did they say to discourage you
[3/2/19, 16:13:58] Yi Hein: To not go Med
[3/2/19, 16:14:11] Trina: Basically that
[3/2/19, 16:14:24] Trina: 2 med students actually gave up PSC for it
[3/2/19, 16:14:29] Trina: 1 regretted the other didn't
[3/2/19, 16:14:40] Trina: So I think it's ultimately a very personal thing
[3/2/19, 16:14:59] Trina: For me I know I will burn out very quickly in med
[3/2/19, 16:15:06] Trina: So it's not my first choice
[3/2/19, 16:15:09] Trina: 🤷‍♀
[3/2/19, 16:15:28] Yi Hein: Law isn't easy either tho
[3/2/19, 16:15:40] Trina: Tru
[3/2/19, 16:15:47] Trina: RIP
[3/2/19, 16:15:59] Yi Hein: The main doctor I was supposed to follow, his Wife is a lawyer
[3/2/19, 16:17:04] Yi Hein: And he says his life is much easier cos he's senior consultant but his Wife's life is tougher the higher she rises
[3/2/19, 16:17:33] Yi Hein: It's the opposite, for Doctors, easier the higher you rise, for Lawyers, harder the higher you rise
[3/2/19, 16:17:41] Trina: DED
[3/2/19, 16:17:49] Trina: but the thing is I don't intend to b a lawyer
[3/2/19, 16:18:00] Trina: If I do go to oxford it's bc I want to join the govt
[3/2/19, 16:18:01] Yi Hein: wait wat
[3/2/19, 16:18:04] Trina: HENCE psc
[3/2/19, 16:18:07] Yi Hein: Wat
[3/2/19, 16:18:17] Trina: Ye
[3/2/19, 16:18:30] Yi Hein: I thought you wanted to do it for lit?
[3/2/19, 16:18:50] Trina: Also that but actually I realised that civil service is a gd choice
[3/2/19, 16:19:02] Trina: Esp with psc bc you get fast tracked for leadership
[3/2/19, 16:19:20] Trina: And it was from the med attachment that I realised doctors are limited in the way they can't help
[3/2/19, 16:19:40] Trina: There are big changes that need to be made to the healthcare system that cannot be made by doctors
[3/2/19, 16:19:50] Trina: This only can be done via public policy
[3/2/19, 16:19:53] Trina: 🤷‍♀🤷‍♀🤷‍♀🤷‍♀
[3/2/19, 16:20:07] Trina: IDK IF I even make sense anymore lolol
[3/2/19, 16:20:24] Yi Hein: So you want PSC Med?
[3/2/19, 16:20:32] Trina: Psc for oxford law
[3/2/19, 16:20:36] Trina: Go into policy making
[3/2/19, 16:20:41] Trina: IDEALLY..
[3/2/19, 16:20:44] Yi Hein: Ohhhh
[3/2/19, 16:21:05] Yi Hein: But policy making you won't really get to see the impact you are making
[3/2/19, 16:21:25] Trina: In a way I think I'm quite utilitarian in terms of helping ppl
[3/2/19, 16:21:31] Trina: I want to have a wider reach
[3/2/19, 16:21:42] Trina: I don't need immediate direct impact
[3/2/19, 16:22:01] Trina: But I just want to know that many ppl have been helped where directly or not
[3/2/19, 16:22:13] Trina: Whether*
[3/2/19, 16:22:28] Yi Hein: Lol same actly but I want both
[3/2/19, 16:22:44] Yi Hein: I've realised that quantity is not everything
[3/2/19, 16:23:01] Yi Hein: But it is something very impt nonetheless
[3/2/19, 16:23:24] Trina: Ya agreed
[3/2/19, 16:23:32] Trina: I just feel doctors are in a bad position
[3/2/19, 16:23:44] Trina: They are people who see the worst cases of neglect and sickness
[3/2/19, 16:23:50] Trina: But are limited in their scope to help
[3/2/19, 16:23:54] Trina: Bc the issue is systemic
[3/2/19, 16:24:05] Yi Hein: Yeah I see what you mean
[3/2/19, 16:24:38] Yi Hein: Do you think being a policy maker would help though?
[3/2/19, 16:24:41] Trina: I guess that's what I meant by issues at home
[3/2/19, 16:24:48] Trina: Financial problems
[3/2/19, 16:24:52] Trina: Unfilial children
[3/2/19, 16:25:21] Yi Hein: I still don't really get the link
[3/2/19, 16:25:23] Trina: It's something u can't change much as a doctor
[3/2/19, 16:25:39] Trina: The reason why so many patients get admitted/ readmityed
[3/2/19, 16:25:43] Trina: Is obv because they are sick
[3/2/19, 16:25:49] Trina: But that's only part of
[3/2/19, 16:25:52] Trina: The story
[3/2/19, 16:26:15] Trina: It's because they don't have support from their family/ structures in place to help them
[3/2/19, 16:26:28] Trina: Eg if they are very old and sick
[3/2/19, 16:26:32] Trina: Dementia or whatever
[3/2/19, 16:26:48] Trina: But no one cares abt monitoring them and caring for them, they end up in the hospital a lot more
[3/2/19, 16:27:00] Trina: Whether for falling/mental health issues e.g. Desperation
[3/2/19, 16:27:06] Trina: * DEPRESSION LOLOL
[3/2/19, 16:27:18] Trina: the sickness is part 1, the reason for it is part 2
[3/2/19, 16:27:49] Trina: And the reasons for it can only be changed via large scale measures
[3/2/19, 16:28:03] Trina: Eg the thingy where u get cheaper HDBs if u live near ur parents
[3/2/19, 16:29:11] Yi Hein: I always have the stereotype that policy makers are very jaded and can't relate though
[3/2/19, 16:30:43] Yi Hein: Tbh my answer to your problem is quite different
[3/2/19, 16:31:37] Yi Hein: If the issue is systematic, and I can't modify it as a doctor, I create a new system
[3/2/19, 16:32:06] Yi Hein: That's where entrepreneurship comes in and revolutionising healthcare
[3/2/19, 16:33:02] Trina: Gd pt
[3/2/19, 16:33:10] Trina: This is a very meaningful discussion
[3/2/19, 16:33:48] Yi Hein: I feel like there are so many aspiring policy makers and so many policy makers currently in the field but the problems can't be fixed easily
[3/2/19, 16:33:54] Trina: Sry for choppy replies am doing STH, but I'll reply u
[3/2/19, 16:34:00] Yi Hein: Kinda forever limited by government Budget and sacricity of resources
[3/2/19, 16:34:02] Trina: Exactly which is quite sad
[3/2/19, 16:34:09] Trina: But I want to try
[3/2/19, 16:34:18] Trina: Idk lah
[3/2/19, 16:34:41] Trina: The problem of inequality is STH I'm quite interested in personally :)
[3/2/19, 16:35:49] Yi Hein: Yeah same but more for inequity for me
[3/2/19, 16:37:54] Trina: YEA
[3/2/19, 16:38:03] Trina: very cool
[3/2/19, 16:39:00] Yi Hein: This problem has existed prob since humanity existed lol
[3/2/19, 16:39:11] Trina: Ye
[3/2/19, 16:39:30] Trina: But there can/should be ways to make it less,, large
[3/2/19, 16:39:39] Trina: As in the gawell
[3/2/19, 16:39:40] Trina: GAP
[3/2/19, 16:39:42] Trina: Hahahah
[3/2/19, 16:39:49] Yi Hein: Hahaha yeah true
[3/2/19, 16:40:01] Yi Hein: what's the life of a policy maker like though
[3/2/19, 16:40:09] Trina: I honestly DK lolol
[3/2/19, 16:40:16] Trina: Not a gd thing
[3/2/19, 16:40:37] Trina: Ministry internships are so hard to get bc they want uni ppl 😫
[3/2/19, 16:40:57] Yi Hein: Oh I see
[3/2/19, 16:42:34] Yi Hein: Ok talk to you soon gonna go run and maybe find some inspiration haha
[3/2/19, 16:43:25] Trina: OK!
[4/2/19, 11:43:14] Yi Hein: My math remark came back
[4/2/19, 11:43:19] Yi Hein: Got 80 kill me now
[4/2/19, 11:46:54] Trina: OMGGGGggg
[4/2/19, 11:46:57] Trina: NOOOOooOooooo
‎[4/2/19, 11:47:22] Trina: ‎sticker omitted
[4/2/19, 11:47:33] Trina: Can remark again
[4/2/19, 11:47:36] Trina: Hahahahahahah
[4/2/19, 11:47:45] Yi Hein: feels bad hahaha but at least i got my money back
[4/2/19, 11:48:16] Trina: POSITIVITY
[4/2/19, 11:48:18] Trina: hahahahah
[4/2/19, 11:48:29] Yi Hein: sooo close hahaha
[4/2/19, 11:48:33] Trina: Does Mr azmi know
[4/2/19, 11:48:39] Yi Hein: i guess it was never meant to be
[4/2/19, 11:48:40] Trina: ARRGGggg very frustrating
[4/2/19, 11:49:26] Yi Hein: he advised against remark cos not much point
[4/2/19, 11:51:01] Yi Hein: maebe 44 easier for cambridge
[4/2/19, 11:51:10] Yi Hein: but many many ppl i've asked told me to do nus med also so idk now
[4/2/19, 11:51:14] Trina: Whatever la at least u tried
[4/2/19, 11:51:30] Trina: If u get in Cambridge
[4/2/19, 11:51:33] Trina: Is it even a qn
[4/2/19, 11:51:39] Trina: CONFIRM GO RIGHT
[4/2/19, 11:51:41] Trina: HHAHAHAH
[4/2/19, 11:52:02] Yi Hein: yeah hahahha
[4/2/19, 11:52:18] Trina: Wait told u to DO or not to do
[4/2/19, 11:52:18] Yi Hein: but i scared come back can't get job cos i'm pr
[4/2/19, 11:52:30] Yi Hein: not to do
[4/2/19, 11:52:31] Trina: Cambridge will have this problem meh
[4/2/19, 11:52:46] Trina: O shit
[4/2/19, 11:52:50] Yi Hein: idk if ucl have then maebe cambridge also
[4/2/19, 11:53:15] Trina: CAMBRIDGE AND UCL DIFF LEAGUE LAH
[4/2/19, 11:53:16] Trina: HAHAHHAHAHA
[4/2/19, 11:53:19] Yi Hein: they said medicine requires good connections which can only be established if u go singapore med school
[4/2/19, 11:53:33] Trina: O no
[4/2/19, 11:53:37] Trina: How so
[4/2/19, 11:53:46] Yi Hein: really? ithought they're quite close in rankings?
[4/2/19, 11:53:59] Trina: U have been building these connections for 12 years alr
[4/2/19, 11:54:11] Trina: If u get in NUS med u are mixing with the exact same people
[4/2/19, 11:54:22] Trina: As long as u maintain these relationships I don't think it's a big deal
[4/2/19, 11:55:01] Trina: Ok la idk abt med but I think generally Cambridge is BTR
[4/2/19, 11:55:43] Yi Hein: idek, the main doctor i was supposed to follow was from cambridge, he said it's good to go for the experience and the exposure, but doesn't neccesarily make me a better doctor
[4/2/19, 11:56:15] Trina: I think it's what u make of it regardless of where u go
[4/2/19, 11:56:40] Trina: But if u think the smaller tutorial style lessons will help u learn better
[4/2/19, 11:56:47] Trina: Then ofc Cambridge is the obv choice
[4/2/19, 11:57:05] Trina: In the first place it's so so so hard to get in alr so can cross the bridge when u get there
[4/2/19, 11:57:55] Yi Hein: hahah yeah
[4/2/19, 11:58:19] Yi Hein: scholarship also a problem though pretty much impossible too
[4/2/19, 11:58:37] Trina: YA esp for med
[4/2/19, 11:59:16] Yi Hein: btw if you were thinking abt becoming a policy maker why don't follow the typical PPE payh
[4/2/19, 11:59:27] Yi Hein: path*
[4/2/19, 11:59:30] Trina: Don't like econs lolol
[4/2/19, 11:59:44] Trina: I didn't even study it but I have NO interest at all
[4/2/19, 11:59:52] Trina: I don't care abt it
[4/2/19, 11:59:55] Trina: Hahahahah
[4/2/19, 12:00:17] Yi Hein: ah i see
[4/2/19, 12:01:37] Yi Hein: after doing ps and in army idk what to do anymore hahhaa
[4/2/19, 12:02:01] Trina: Hahahahah my brain also degraded alr
[4/2/19, 12:02:10] Trina: Are u trying NTU
[4/2/19, 12:02:31] Yi Hein: Cannot 3.7 already out
[4/2/19, 12:02:40] Trina: ZZZ sad
[4/2/19, 12:02:55] Trina: Wow then NUS med ONLY?!
[4/2/19, 12:03:06] Yi Hein: Yeah
[4/2/19, 12:03:19] Yi Hein: Tbh don't have high hopes for that either
[4/2/19, 12:03:20] Trina: SCARY
[4/2/19, 12:03:25] Trina: WHY
[4/2/19, 12:03:53] Yi Hein: After internship, I realised I'm actually wouldn't be very good in medicine
[4/2/19, 12:03:58] Yi Hein: In terms of working skill
[4/2/19, 12:04:08] Trina: Because of what
[4/2/19, 12:05:07] Yi Hein: Like they said you can't make mistakes, must multitask very well, must be coordinated, must be decisive, mind cannot drift off
[4/2/19, 12:05:20] Yi Hein: fits exactly to all my weaknesses lmao
[4/2/19, 12:05:25] Trina: HAHAHAH
[4/2/19, 12:05:36] Trina: i laughed
[4/2/19, 12:05:45] Trina: ERRRR then med is very vocational leh
[4/2/19, 12:05:51] Trina: Confirm will be doctor one
[4/2/19, 12:06:00] Trina: Career switch is very hard/ unlikely
[4/2/19, 12:06:22] Yi Hein: hmm what do you mean
[4/2/19, 12:06:36] Trina: U study medicine directly to become a doctor
[4/2/19, 12:06:51] Yi Hein: it's like cos they test for all those things in the interview
[4/2/19, 12:07:18] Trina: Ya that and if u are considering business then study med for whaat
[4/2/19, 12:09:04] Yi Hein: gotta be deeply involved to see what I can change and doing Med is sth I'll won't regret cos it'll be fulfilling
[4/2/19, 12:09:26] Trina: OK then u got your answer right
[4/2/19, 12:09:36] Trina: Don't care too much abt what other ppl say about studying med
[4/2/19, 12:09:48] Trina: It's a personal choice n you alr know you won't regret it
[4/2/19, 12:10:02] Trina: 👌🏻
[4/2/19, 12:10:41] Yi Hein: Oh I wait I was referring to them telling me to do NUS Med over Cambridge
[4/2/19, 12:10:48] Trina: O NO

[4/2/19, 23:36:53] Yi Hein: 4th attempt, completely went freestyle on this one
[4/2/19, 23:37:07] Yi Hein: definitely not gonna use this, but maybe something in it would be useful?
[4/2/19, 23:38:06] Trina: ok!
[4/2/19, 23:39:24] Trina: Ok I scanned through
[4/2/19, 23:39:33] Trina: It's MUCH more interesting
[4/2/19, 23:39:55] Trina: It would b gd if u can distill it into one shorter opening para
[4/2/19, 23:40:15] Trina: Then weave in your previous research experience/other volunteering work/running
[4/2/19, 23:40:19] Trina: THEN PERFECT ALR
[4/2/19, 23:41:33] Yi Hein: i don't think i'm going to use it though, cos talking about death of grandparents has become so cliche that it's memeable for med school app
[4/2/19, 23:41:50] Trina: Ahhahaha memeable
[4/2/19, 23:42:06] Trina: OK but this is the correct approach rly
[4/2/19, 23:42:11] Trina: MUCH less deadpan
[4/2/19, 23:43:36] Yi Hein: ok thanks so much, i'll think about how to weave other stuff in
[8/2/19, 04:45:21] Yi Hein: sent you my latest ps, would appreciate if u take a look

[9/2/19, 21:58:52] Yi Hein: Have u submitted your application?
[9/2/19, 21:59:48] Yi Hein: Can't seem to go into the Yong loo lin one
[9/2/19, 22:36:29] Trina: SAME
[9/2/19, 22:36:34] Trina: it's still 2018 right
[9/2/19, 22:36:40] Trina: 😔😤

[9/2/19, 22:48:57] Trina: NO PROBLEM!
[10/2/19, 10:34:16] Yi Hein: For the main application no need ps right?
[10/2/19, 10:43:00] Trina: I think u don't because u aren't applying for anything else
[10/2/19, 10:43:31] Trina: If my second choice is law do u know if I'm supposed to write the main application PS for law
[10/2/19, 10:43:38] Trina: I have no 3rd choice
[10/2/19, 10:51:43] Yi Hein: Yeah you'll need to
[10/2/19, 10:52:25] Yi Hein: But the ps in the main portal should be general
[10/2/19, 10:54:23] Yi Hein: But since no 3rd choice and Med don't look at your ps, then should be safe to write for law
[10/2/19, 10:54:34] Yi Hein: you should double check tho
[10/2/19, 10:57:38] Trina: Ya that's what I thought

[11/2/19, 13:38:43] Trina: the old one ah
[11/2/19, 13:38:53] Yi Hein: The last one I sent you
[11/2/19, 13:39:03] Trina: ahh ok thats the btr one
[11/2/19, 13:39:26] Yi Hein: She said I need to show the qualities I have that makes me a good doctor
[11/2/19, 13:39:40] Yi Hein: And support with anecdotal evidence
[11/2/19, 13:39:49] Trina: thats all?
[11/2/19, 13:40:01] Trina: yay means q gd alr
[11/2/19, 13:40:30] Yi Hein: Dear Yi Hein, from your personal statement, I cannot filter out the reason why you want to Medicine. This personal statement can also apply to a researcher or scientist. While it hihglights your passion to serve others, this can also be fulfilled via other pathways like social work. Being a doctor is more than serving others. I think you need to think and reflect deeper into why you want to pursue Medicine, the relevant experience and qualities you have that will make you a good doctor and support them with ancedotal evidence.
[11/2/19, 13:40:55] Yi Hein: what did she say about yours?
[11/2/19, 13:41:07] Trina: i sent her as word doc
[11/2/19, 13:41:11] Trina: the comments r
[11/2/19, 13:41:31] Trina: This does not clarify your interests in Medicine.
[11/2/19, 13:41:32] Trina: How did you arrive at this newfound interest?
[11/2/19, 13:41:40] Trina: How is this relevant in your pursuit of Medicine?
[11/2/19, 13:41:47] Trina: You might be wasting word count here
[11/2/19, 13:42:00] Trina: More details about what you saw and learn that helped you in your decision to pursue Medicine will be good.
[11/2/19, 13:42:02] Trina: thats all
[11/2/19, 13:42:06] Trina: vague right
[11/2/19, 13:42:13] Yi Hein: Yeah
[11/2/19, 13:42:21] Trina: i just concluded that i need to link more
[11/2/19, 13:42:42] Yi Hein: She's Econs teacher so she may be more rigid in a sense
[11/2/19, 13:42:57] Trina: ya i think she likes the fixed format kind
[11/2/19, 13:43:16] Yi Hein: Idk what admissions ppl want though

[13/2/19, 09:20:26] Trina: ok i did another draft.. i think this one covers everything u mentioned in draft 3 so probably u cld just choose the one u prefer stylistically since content is kinda standardised alr

Really love your enthusiasm, quirkiness and you're really fun to talk to! So keep being who you are and I'm sure you'll make a meaningful impact in the lives of others! 😊

[27/3/19, 21:33:27] Yi Hein: hahhaha
[27/3/19, 21:33:28] Trina: Does he even know how to write sentences
[27/3/19, 21:33:55] Trina: I hav never seen him write ANYTHING before
[27/3/19, 21:34:09] Trina: This in itself is a miracle

[27/3/19, 21:34:43] Yi Hein: HAHAHAHA honestly kinda a risky choice, cos if he doesn't know how to write, doesn't matter how well he knows me

[27/3/19, 21:35:10] Trina: Ya

[27/3/19, 21:42:07] Yi Hein: Soz I'm panicking
[27/3/19, 21:42:08] Trina: ok plan stuff n see through??
[27/3/19, 21:42:25] Trina: or for u just say u go for training la
[27/3/19, 21:52:06] Yi Hein: Despite the numerous activities Yi Hein is involved in, he ensures that he is deeply committed to each of them. For example, on one of the days, Yi Hein diligently went for a consult with his teacher to clarify his doubts, followed by attending the Student Council General Meeting, followed by attending Youth Diplomat’s Society weekly debate training. 
After this, he still competed his Cross Country training by 8pm. After training, he had a Skype meeting at 8pm for the student council event he was planning, followed by another Skype meeting at 12am for the Peer Mentorship Programme he was pioneering. His typical school day lasts much longer than his peers due to his various commitments. Nonetheless, Yi Hein remains undaunted for he is deeply passionate each activity he commits himself to. He is keenly aware that his work is serving a cause bigger than himself and as such, he pushes himself to strive for excellence in all that he does. Such passion has been a key driving force in enabling Yi Hein to overcome stressful periods which his peers would otherwise find impossible.
[27/3/19, 21:52:22] Yi Hein: how's this? idk sound a bit cringey
[27/3/19, 21:52:59] Trina: Can but I don't think u shd include the time
[27/3/19, 21:53:05] Trina: And don't list it so systematically
[27/3/19, 21:53:13] Trina: Bc the teacher wouldn't know ur schedule realistically
[27/3/19, 21:53:25] Yi Hein: oh yeah true
[28/3/19, 04:33:54] Yi Hein: what do u think demonstrates good communication skills?
[28/3/19, 07:00:43] Trina: talk abt MUN or sth
[28/3/19, 07:32:01] Trina: idt I'll join you all on Sunday- I think I prep better for interviews on my own hahahaha

[1/4/19, 18:44:18] Trina: okok
[1/4/19, 18:44:24] Trina: M GNA B POSITIVE YOooooo
[1/4/19, 18:44:30] Trina: thanks agn
[1/4/19, 22:03:16] Yi Hein: for MMI there were 5 stations: 
- the group interview : i personally think i did the worst at this but lol the majority of those in my grp got in hahah (so i’d say it’s a low weightage): i found it rly hard because everyone else was so alpha and tried to be the “leader” of the grp but i personally feel that it can be a bit overdone and appear fake haha so really just be yourself and try to help the grp as much as u can :) 

- 2 role-play ones (no way to prepare, just be spontaneous): can’t rly rmb mine but it was like “talk yo your difficult group member who is not doing his work” haha

- 1 pressure test: they give u a bunch of random test and then mid way throw a vv impossible challenge at you, basically to see how u respond in stressful situations ; just chill and rmb not to panic and you’ll confirm b fine (also the no. of tasks u complete doesn’t rly matter i think but it helps to do as many as you can :) 

- and lastly, the 15 min personal interview: standard qns here aka personal, ethics, situational and current affair qns ( i have a list of prac qns i used n i’ll send them to u when i get home!) : my advise is to rly be yourself and try not to sound over-rehearsed 

also, be prepared to wait id day a max of 3hrs before your interview esp if you’re unlucky like me and get the last slot of the day and have to wait as everyone else is tested.
 
rmb that at the end of the day the interview is to help them get to know you better. 
your interviewers are also likely to be doctors/other healthcare professionals/professors so do address them as “dr/professor” instead of “mdm/sir” haha (i kept making this mistake) 

hope this helps and the interview is actly quite fun so please enjoy it! also you can make friends with those around you while you wait, i think it helps de-stress unless you’re sitting to mr.perfect and that intimidates you haha 
all the best and lemme know how it goes!! ☺☺
[1/4/19, 22:03:28] Yi Hein: Some advice my senior sent me ^^^
[1/4/19, 22:03:34] Yi Hein: Hope this helps!!!

[5/4/19, 21:36:14] Trina: So I said compassion if I had to pick
[5/4/19, 21:36:40] Trina: Bc putting patients first means u will do ur best to be the most competent doctor to serve them
[5/4/19, 21:36:42] Trina: Sth like that
[5/4/19, 21:36:44] Trina: LOOOL
[5/4/19, 21:37:06] Yi Hein: Hmm I thought compassion was like serving with a heart and treating them well?
[5/4/19, 21:37:20] Trina: I thought it was feeling for another person
[5/4/19, 21:37:29] Trina: And if u feel for them enough u will want to treat them
[5/4/19, 21:37:43] Yi Hein: Like u can be the nicest doctor in town but you don't have any medical knowledge
[5/4/19, 21:37:48] Trina: And if u want to treat them to the best of ur ability u will naturally make yourself competent
[5/4/19, 21:37:59] Trina: At least that was how I saw it haha
[5/4/19, 21:38:15] Yi Hein: Yeah it's reasonable
[5/4/19, 21:38:43] Trina: Idk how to feel abt FSA bc I think I did ok but I didn't stand out??
[5/4/19, 21:38:54] Trina: Will find out in a month hahaha
[5/4/19, 21:39:17] Yi Hein: Yeah fingers crossed 🤞🏼
[5/4/19, 21:39:46] Yi Hein: My senior said for the ppl she knows, the alpha ppl during group didn't get in lol
[5/4/19, 21:39:55] Trina: Wth speaking of alpha
[5/4/19, 21:40:05] Trina: The alpha guy in my group has literally NOOO EQ
[5/4/19, 21:40:10] Trina: o my dear lord
[5/4/19, 21:40:14] Yi Hein: What did he do omg
[5/4/19, 21:40:23] Trina: At the end of the interview they asked everyone one QN right
[5/4/19, 21:40:35] Trina: Ok so he was the "I WANNA BE A LEADER!!!" guy
[5/4/19, 21:40:52] Trina: And the interviewer asked him "do u think everyone contributed equally"
[5/4/19, 21:41:24] Trina: Omg the guy had the nerve to say "I think everyone had their ideas heard. But whether everyone contributed equally.. hm.. I think some ppl can do more"
[5/4/19, 21:41:27] Trina: WTHHHHHHHHHHH
[5/4/19, 21:41:45] Yi Hein: Lol so contradictory HAHAHA
[5/4/19, 21:41:53] Yi Hein: it's a red flag from me HAHAHAHA
[5/4/19, 21:42:03] Trina: This is the WORST PLACE u can say this
[5/4/19, 21:42:23] Trina: 1. In a GROUP station
2. In a MED interview
3. After trying to b the leader
[5/4/19, 21:42:51] Yi Hein: Welp I hope the interviews know what there doing and not choose him
[5/4/19, 21:42:51] Trina: 4. In front of all the SAID GRP MEMBERS
[5/4/19, 21:43:10] Yi Hein: what did they ask you for the qns part?
[5/4/19, 21:43:23] Trina: How do u think ur team worked tgt or sth
[5/4/19, 21:43:29] Trina: I forgot
[5/4/19, 21:43:45] Yi Hein: Ah ok yeah qns are all the same
[5/4/19, 21:43:48] Trina: Or why do u think u worked well tgt???? Sth like that
[5/4/19, 21:43:50] Trina: YA ok
[5/4/19, 21:44:19] Yi Hein: Even though my group was Super wholesome, they still asked whether everyone contributed equally
[5/4/19, 21:44:47] Yi Hein: My qn & a was horrible though...cos I was last and didn't have much time
[5/4/19, 21:44:55] Trina: What they ask
[5/4/19, 21:45:12] Yi Hein: What did you think the group could have done better
[5/4/19, 21:45:29] Trina: Is it also the deserted island QN
[5/4/19, 21:45:40] Yi Hein: Honestly the teamwork was pretty solid...so not much to add on 🤷🏻‍♂️
[5/4/19, 21:45:48] Yi Hein: The Borneo crash landing?
[5/4/19, 21:45:51] Trina: Ye

[5/4/19, 21:46:13] Trina: No pt changing hahaha

[5/4/19, 21:50:43] Trina: OH we didn't
[5/4/19, 21:50:54] Yi Hein: Then no choice had to swap that for the magnifying glass and candles
[5/4/19, 21:51:27] Trina: After the swap we had 2 maggi mees for 3 days with many ppl
[5/4/19, 21:51:32] Trina: Logistically not sound
[5/4/19, 21:51:36] Yi Hein: Tbh this activity was I was considering it for one of the student council station tests
[5/4/19, 21:51:50] Yi Hein: And what you eventually choose doesn't matter at all
[5/4/19, 21:52:19] Yi Hein: Like as Long as you can reason logically...but the main part is see how ppl work together
[5/4/19, 21:52:33] Trina: The alpha guy... when the whole thing was at its midpt.. asked 1. If there were severely injured ppl 2. Said we dk how long we will be there
[5/4/19, 21:52:41] Trina: He has a severe comprehension problem
[5/4/19, 21:52:52] Trina: Ok la but teamwork wise I think not bad
[5/4/19, 21:52:53] Yi Hein: I think he's stressed too HAHAHAHA
[5/4/19, 21:53:02] Trina: This was my internal monologue only
[5/4/19, 21:53:06] Trina: Hence
[5/4/19, 21:53:31] Yi Hein: you are in a good position
[5/4/19, 21:53:50] Yi Hein: Cos you're not aggresive and can work with ppl
[5/4/19, 21:53:58] Trina: Idk if I talked enough though?
[5/4/19, 21:54:07] Trina: Bc they were all trying to get a word in right
[5/4/19, 21:54:16] Trina: So I was like ok.. let u all talk :):): bye
[5/4/19, 21:54:32] Yi Hein: Maybe you can try voicing out your past 50 messages HAHAHAHA

[5/4/19, 21:55:51] Yi Hein: such as?
[5/4/19, 21:56:22] Trina: "Hey u know we don't have to use the balloons for their intended purpose! They may be useful for storage :):))::)"
[5/4/19, 21:56:26] Trina: They said OK

[5/4/19, 21:57:48] Yi Hein: I was trying to reason with the IPPT guy so badly omg
[5/4/19, 21:57:59] Trina: did it work hahahaha
[5/4/19, 21:58:12] Yi Hein: He was saying how compassionate and caring he is in helping others....
[5/4/19, 21:58:16] Yi Hein: cheat in IPPT
[5/4/19, 21:58:38] Trina: Did it have a conclusion
[5/4/19, 21:59:18] Yi Hein: Ran out of time then he quickly said 'you gave me a lot of think about' then told me to leave
[5/4/19, 21:59:28] Yi Hein: I think they have pre-planned answers
[5/4/19, 21:59:32] Yi Hein: To our responses
[5/4/19, 21:59:43] Trina: Ya mine concluded for one
[5/4/19, 21:59:49] Trina: The other one was sth like that also

[5/4/19, 22:00:08] Yi Hein: Yeah I didn't have any conclusion rippp
[5/4/19, 22:00:25] Trina: It was q hard right
[5/4/19, 22:00:34] Trina: And awkward, more imptly
[5/4/19, 22:00:47] Yi Hein: I asked him like deep in his heart did he feel something is wrong...then he kept avoiding the question multiple times
[5/4/19, 22:01:14] Trina: Maybe they r not supposed to take a stand
[5/4/19, 22:01:19] Trina: Same thing happened w me
[5/4/19, 22:01:38] Yi Hein: hmm what do you mean not take a stand
[5/4/19, 22:01:48] Yi Hein: I mean it's soo obvious it's wrong
[5/4/19, 22:02:03] Trina: They r supposed to show that they haven't made up their mind
[5/4/19, 22:02:32] Yi Hein: I totally forgot it was an ethics station
[5/4/19, 22:03:06] Yi Hein: So I didn't explicitly say that it was wrong 😩 was trying to guide him into saying that...which he didn't :/

[5/4/19, 22:19:36] Trina: I asked her "NANCY. Do u want to do the same as them."
[5/4/19, 22:19:41] Trina: She said "idk"

[7/4/19, 12:47:22] Yi Hein: you didn't apply dentistry right?
[7/4/19, 12:47:25] Trina: Nop
[7/4/19, 12:47:48] Yi Hein: Ejin said it was quite easy though
[7/4/19, 12:47:49] Yi Hein: Idk man
[7/4/19, 12:48:01] Yi Hein: I've no morals
[7/4/19, 12:48:02] Trina: I think this one hard to gauge la
[7/4/19, 12:48:13] Trina: No clearly right answer
[7/4/19, 12:48:54] Trina: ITS OVER!! YES no more nus med stuff 💯✌🏻
[7/4/19, 12:49:07] Trina: M too lazy for more tests alr
[7/4/19, 12:49:14] Yi Hein: Hahahaha that's ends my entire Uni app
[7/4/19, 12:49:25] Yi Hein: Still a marathon ahead of you 🤣
[7/4/19, 12:49:28] Trina: YEZZZZ
[7/4/19, 12:49:33] Trina: Congrats!
[7/4/19, 12:49:39] Trina: YA RIP
[10/4/19, 21:05:30] Yi Hein: hey what are some pros and cons you considered when applying uk instead of just going local?
[10/4/19, 21:24:12] Trina: hello tbh I didn't think I would get in so I just applied for fun... I thought I would regret not applying so I did 🤦‍♀
[10/4/19, 22:24:33] Yi Hein: Oh lol I see
[10/4/19, 22:25:47] Yi Hein: So for you regardless of uni you go to, goal is public service?
[10/4/19, 22:29:47] Trina: ye. but at that time I was sure I was gna do med tho. U.K. law was just a shot in the dark
[10/4/19, 22:30:47] Trina: I didn't rly care if I got in or not? it was just a subj I had mild interest in/thought it aligned w my acad interests/not 300k a year like med is
[10/4/19, 22:31:16] Yi Hein: I Guess life takes unexpected turns haha
[10/4/19, 22:31:27] Trina: hek ikr
[10/4/19, 22:32:26] Yi Hein: but to make the switch from Med (which you were so sure) to law isn't it kinda hard?
[10/4/19, 22:32:47] Trina: not rly
[10/4/19, 22:33:03] Trina: think I just gradually came to terms w the fact that I'm not exactly gifted in the sciences
[10/4/19, 22:33:12] Trina: LOLOL I just get by through studying
[10/4/19, 22:33:52] Yi Hein: LOL isn't that how everyone does well in science does
[10/4/19, 22:34:23] Trina: RLY MEH I just think it doesn't come to me as naturally as languagey things do
[10/4/19, 22:34:59] Trina: even now I think I'd be happy doing either med or law 🤷‍♀
[10/4/19, 22:35:06] Trina: there's no math involved in either
[10/4/19, 22:35:32] Yi Hein: hahaha Azmi would be disappointed 😂
[10/4/19, 22:36:00] Trina: hate math man
[10/4/19, 22:36:16] Yi Hein: recently I've been reconsidering the plan of applying Cambridge
[10/4/19, 22:36:39] Yi Hein: So yeah wanted to know whether it was worth it for the risks and effort
[10/4/19, 22:36:56] Trina: what's the risk?
[10/4/19, 22:37:38] Yi Hein: I realise I would graduate at 28
[10/4/19, 22:37:55] Yi Hein: And if I don't get Cambridge/scholarship I'll be 1 year behind everyone
[10/4/19, 22:38:13] Trina: omg what
[10/4/19, 22:38:59] Yi Hein: Yeah cos the Med course is 6 years + 11 months of doing nothing cos my ORD is nov and Cambridge starts in October
[10/4/19, 22:39:15] Trina: that suks
[10/4/19, 22:39:36] Trina: ok but nothing to lose by applying right
[10/4/19, 22:39:44] Trina: the chances r damn low anyways
[10/4/19, 22:40:29] Yi Hein: as in I'll have to decide whether or not to defer if I get NUS med
[10/4/19, 22:40:48] Yi Hein: So it's quite a notable change in trajectory
[10/4/19, 22:41:02] Trina: does Cambridge med give u any advantages as a doctor
[10/4/19, 22:41:13] Trina: I actually wouldn't think that it would that much leh
[10/4/19, 22:41:59] Trina: I guess if u do go it's for the tutorials/experience/brand
[10/4/19, 22:42:17] Yi Hein: mainly the scientific rigour and the research focus, cos the Teachers are leaders in their research field
[10/4/19, 22:42:46] Yi Hein: But tbh I'm hoping to get some international connections for potential business partners hahaha
[10/4/19, 22:43:01] Trina: u also not gna do research right
[10/4/19, 22:43:13] Trina: NUS trains u gd enough to be a safe doctor alr
[10/4/19, 22:43:26] Trina: loooooOooool that's one reason
[10/4/19, 22:43:43] Trina: just go exchange or sth lah
[10/4/19, 22:43:48] Yi Hein: Yeah not anytime soon in my career, only if I can self-fund my own lab later in life
[10/4/19, 22:44:10] Trina: then the research focus is not v beneficial also right
[10/4/19, 22:45:03] Yi Hein: Yeah not exactly, but more of the first principles thinking process it develops (kinda like how AChia Teaches hahaha)
[10/4/19, 22:45:29] Trina: ya get what u mean :/ but is that worth graduating at 28
[10/4/19, 22:45:57] Trina: if u just go NUS by 28 you will be a MO alr right
[10/4/19, 22:46:29] Yi Hein: It's I'm good enough prob junior/senior residency
[10/4/19, 22:46:47] Trina: ya lor. 28 start at HO damn sian leh
[10/4/19, 22:47:17] Yi Hein: Yeah idk
[10/4/19, 22:47:24] Yi Hein: can't even imagine myself at 28
[10/4/19, 22:47:32] Yi Hein: Sooo old already
[10/4/19, 22:48:39] Yi Hein: I asked a senior in Cambridge and he said it was worthit LOL
[10/4/19, 22:48:51] Yi Hein: But he's biased to his own school ofc
[10/4/19, 22:48:58] Trina: dang DILEMMA TIME
[10/4/19, 22:49:30] Trina: ok la u hav time to think abt it
[10/4/19, 22:49:46] Trina: at least in 1 month NUS will release med results
[10/4/19, 22:49:52] Trina: n you can actually decide
[10/4/19, 22:50:38] Yi Hein: Or NUS can decide for me if they reject me hahahaha
[10/4/19, 22:51:04] Yi Hein: you're def gonna work in public service?
[10/4/19, 22:51:12] Trina: m pretty sure
[10/4/19, 22:51:26] Trina: I don't think I would survive in private
[10/4/19, 22:51:38] Yi Hein: why tho
[10/4/19, 22:52:02] Trina: generalisation but seems like there's a greater need to keep up appearances/backstab
[10/4/19, 22:52:16] Trina: /rely on SOCIAL SKILLZ
[10/4/19, 22:52:40] Yi Hein: HAHAHA cos you're a nice person
[10/4/19, 22:52:43] Yi Hein: And don't backstab?
[10/4/19, 22:53:09] Trina: it would def take a toil on me
[10/4/19, 22:53:17] Trina: n I think it's a bit too transactional
[10/4/19, 22:53:20] Trina: private sector
[10/4/19, 22:53:39] Yi Hein: Like money centric?
[10/4/19, 22:53:59] Trina: yep
[10/4/19, 22:54:14] Yi Hein: But in public service would you even do law related stuff though?
[10/4/19, 22:54:24] Trina: probs not
[10/4/19, 22:54:27] Trina: which is gd
[10/4/19, 22:54:36] Yi Hein: Compared to those PPE/PPL scholars
[10/4/19, 22:54:46] Trina: I wanna study it but I rly dw to spend my life fighting ppl in court
[10/4/19, 22:54:58] Trina: it would be OK.. but not fulfilling
[10/4/19, 22:55:39] Yi Hein: huh so your Uni education  won't be directly related to your career?
[10/4/19, 22:56:04] Trina: I guess so
[10/4/19, 22:56:18] Trina: but I'm sure legal knowledge is relevant to policy
[10/4/19, 22:57:06] Trina: anyways this relies on whether psc actually replies me so m not gna get AHEAD OF MYSELF LOLOLol
[10/4/19, 22:58:06] Yi Hein: (Touch wood) So if no Psc then how?
[10/4/19, 22:58:30] Trina: SIGH go oxford ask parents pay LOLOL
[10/4/19, 22:58:42] Yi Hein: as in for your career?
[10/4/19, 22:58:42] Trina: OR if I get NUS med reconsider all my choices agn
[10/4/19, 22:59:00] Trina: OH I'd probs still wanna do policy work
[10/4/19, 22:59:21] Trina: if cannot then just work for a law firm? do litigation or sth
[10/4/19, 22:59:44] Yi Hein: Ah ok I see
[10/4/19, 23:00:35] Yi Hein: I Guess its nice that you're flexible in what you wanna do
[10/4/19, 23:01:11] Trina: SIGH it's because idk what I wanna do
[10/4/19, 23:01:18] Trina: M INDECISIVE!
[10/4/19, 23:01:33] Yi Hein: Hahaha it's a good thing
[10/4/19, 23:01:36] Trina: if u couldn't alr guess
[10/4/19, 23:01:45] Trina: 🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀
[10/4/19, 23:02:18] Yi Hein: The doctor emailed for attachment wanted to be a story teller...now he's head of department for cancer research at SGH
[10/4/19, 23:02:28] Trina: LOOOOOL
[10/4/19, 23:03:09] Yi Hein: for me it feels weird to be so sure abt everything and what I want to do but then suddenly totally lost again
[10/4/19, 23:03:31] Yi Hein: I Guess just take what comes my way lol
[10/4/19, 23:03:42] Trina: nah u doin ok
[10/4/19, 23:03:51] Trina: most ppl hav no idea what they want to do
[10/4/19, 23:04:06] Trina: I think everyone is faking it until they make it u know
[10/4/19, 23:04:30] Trina: q impossible to decide what u want at 18 tbh
[10/4/19, 23:05:16] Yi Hein: Yeah man but the decision would follow through till I'm 28 ripppp
[10/4/19, 23:05:34] Trina: UNFORTUNATELY
[10/4/19, 23:06:00] Trina: at that pt u just have to own ur decision alr. convince urself that u lov Cambridge
[10/4/19, 23:06:38] Yi Hein: Hahahaha we'll see how it's goes
[10/4/19, 23:07:02] Yi Hein: All the best for your PSC results!!!! Tell me how it goes too

[10/4/19, 23:09:26] Yi Hein: LOOOL then what do you do to fill the time

[10/4/19, 23:11:20] Yi Hein: Isn't it quite boring to stay all day at home too
[10/4/19, 23:11:44] Trina: 1. WAKE UP WHENEVER I WANT
[10/4/19, 23:12:07] Trina: 2. no wasting time travelling
[10/4/19, 23:12:50] Yi Hein: But then how do you entertain yourself
[10/4/19, 23:13:04] Trina: @ pa.. pls let me work from home.. I'm literally doing the same thing I do in office.. which is nothing..,
[10/4/19, 23:13:51] Trina: infinitely many ways to entertain myself. that is the least of my worries. sth about being confined the whole day in a box of a office makes me angry
[10/4/19, 23:14:24] Yi Hein: I can feel the sian meter sky rocketing
[10/4/19, 23:14:37] Yi Hein: Send them a Resignation letter?

[10/4/19, 23:18:13] Yi Hein: Ok lah quite late already

[18/4/19, 23:27:15] Yi Hein: No idea what that means hahaha
[18/4/19, 23:27:47] Yi Hein: How's favouring majority related to court of appeals
[18/4/19, 23:28:08] Trina: What if the gov wanted to pass a law on sth like "Chinese pay less taxes"
[18/4/19, 23:28:13] Trina: And you don't want that

[18/4/19, 23:30:38] Trina: Blabla gov need to respect sg's core beliefs etc
[18/4/19, 23:30:43] Trina: IDEK at this pt

[18/4/19, 23:32:47] Trina: probs but I just said that can change but not for the worse lah
[18/4/19, 23:33:04] Trina: So these kinda policies would fall under category of "change for the worse" hahahahah

[21/4/19, 21:46:19] Trina: *EQUALITY!*
[21/4/19, 21:46:37] Yi Hein: the girls are literally worth more than 3 of us...feelsbadman

[21/4/19, 21:47:01] Yi Hein: btw do you know joella
[21/4/19, 21:47:12] Trina: i know who she is but not personally
[21/4/19, 21:47:36] Yi Hein: she signed on for fun, like she's not even actually going to have a career in the military
[21/4/19, 21:47:48] Yi Hein: Honestly idk how some ppl think
[21/4/19, 21:47:56] Trina: but can get scholarship right
[21/4/19, 21:48:00] Trina: lifehacks
[21/4/19, 21:48:03] Yi Hein: Yeah but she doesn't want
[21/4/19, 21:48:07] Trina: HUH??
[21/4/19, 21:48:11] Trina: ok that is MAD
[21/4/19, 21:48:39] Yi Hein: Cos she's wants to do Med but doesn't want to work as a doctor for SAF
[21/4/19, 21:49:02] Yi Hein: ^ honestly idk who would....stress of a doctor + regimentation of the army
[21/4/19, 21:49:07] Yi Hein: Double trouble
[21/4/19, 21:49:30] Trina: i thought they would treat doctors damn well
[21/4/19, 21:50:00] Trina: u mean the doctors are subject to the army nonsense??
[21/4/19, 21:50:18] Yi Hein: honestly the Doctors rank not really respected cos they don't earn it through merit but just cos they're a doctor
[21/4/19, 21:50:38] Trina: that is so not worth it
[21/4/19, 21:51:03] Trina: i think med results come out start may leh
[21/4/19, 21:51:14] Yi Hein: Yeah first week of May
[21/4/19, 21:51:43] Yi Hein: High stakes haha
[21/4/19, 21:51:55] Trina: yaaaa

[21/4/19, 21:54:11] Trina: EYES CROSSED EVEN
[21/4/19, 21:54:16] Yi Hein: LOOL
[21/4/19, 21:54:26] Trina: the law interviewer had a lazy eye
[21/4/19, 21:54:40] Trina: it was q weird bc i didnt know which eye to look at tbh
[21/4/19, 21:54:59] Trina: JKKKKKKKK i looked at the NORMAL EYE OK
[21/4/19, 21:55:24] Yi Hein: Omg wut hahahaha
[21/4/19, 21:55:56] Yi Hein: Look at his forehead/nose
[21/4/19, 21:56:36] Yi Hein: That reminds me for NUS Med the group interviewer had an intense Chinese accent that no one understood
[21/4/19, 21:56:57] Yi Hein: Then we did it wrongly until he had to step in
[21/4/19, 21:56:58] Yi Hein: Rippp
[21/4/19, 21:57:06] Trina: ahhahahahah
[21/4/19, 21:57:11] Trina: i tried to use that tactic
[21/4/19, 21:57:16] Trina: the eyebrow thing
[21/4/19, 21:57:25] Trina: BUT I WAS TOO SCARED SO ABORT MISSION ABORT MISSION
[21/4/19, 21:57:34] Trina: i just looked into empty space while i thought omg
[21/4/19, 21:57:35] Yi Hein: HAHAHAHA
[21/4/19, 21:57:54] Trina: embarrassing for ALL PPLS INVOLVED
[21/4/19, 21:58:04] Trina: even the interviewer
[21/4/19, 21:58:46] Yi Hein: Idk man he'll prob think we can't listen to instructions
[21/4/19, 21:58:55] Yi Hein: No one dared to tell him his accent was too strong hahaha
[21/4/19, 21:59:10] Trina: HHAHahah
[21/4/19, 21:59:46] Yi Hein: have you gone for an interview where you weren't really passionate abt it / didn't really want it?
[21/4/19, 22:00:15] Yi Hein: Idk how to perform well in such situations
[21/4/19, 22:00:20] Trina: dont think so leh
[21/4/19, 22:00:26] Trina: what interview r u having?
[21/4/19, 22:01:04] Yi Hein: not cfm but in future there's chance for an interview to select for positions in the cadet governance system
[21/4/19, 22:02:01] Trina: why would u go if u dw tho
[21/4/19, 22:02:16] Yi Hein: Like my buddy said for interviews he created a character of himself that he believes fits the interview and stuck to it...and he became CWC
[21/4/19, 22:03:11] Yi Hein: I wanna have the leadership training and experience but the problem is I've utterly no passion for the military
[21/4/19, 22:03:43] Trina: i loled
[21/4/19, 22:03:48] Yi Hein: Lmilitary and medicine are quite far apart...killing vs saving lives
[21/4/19, 22:04:31] Trina: hm ok time 2 employ:
‎[21/4/19, 22:04:42] Trina: ‎GIF omitted
[21/4/19, 22:04:52] Yi Hein: Hahahaha omg
[21/4/19, 22:05:03] Yi Hein: Gets me everytime
[21/4/19, 22:05:16] Yi Hein: Teach me your ways
[21/4/19, 22:05:29] Trina: doublethink urself into liking it lah
[21/4/19, 22:05:49] Yi Hein: doublethink?
[21/4/19, 22:06:05] Trina: some 1984 thing
[21/4/19, 22:06:31] Yi Hein: So recite "I love army" to sleep at night?
[21/4/19, 22:06:34] Trina: the acceptance of contrary opinions or beliefs at the same time, especially as a result of political indoctrination.
[21/4/19, 22:06:45] Trina: come up w the pros n FORGET THE CONS LOL
[21/4/19, 22:07:30] Yi Hein: Is this the translation of the above text
[21/4/19, 22:08:58] Trina: LOLOL
[21/4/19, 22:09:05] Trina: can also
[21/4/19, 22:09:48] Yi Hein: Oh nice there's a Wikipedia article on it
[21/4/19, 22:09:59] Trina: yeeeee
[21/4/19, 22:10:29] Yi Hein: Have you tried using this?
[21/4/19, 22:10:50] Trina: hmm i dont think so
[21/4/19, 22:11:05] Trina: i just think be frank enough but dont say incriminating stuff
[21/4/19, 22:12:06] Yi Hein: how is being frank and non-incriminating related tho
[21/4/19, 22:12:23] Trina: dont say my biggest flaw is racism or sth lah
[21/4/19, 22:12:43] Yi Hein: HAHAHA
[21/4/19, 22:12:57] Yi Hein: I see it's like a fine balance
[21/4/19, 22:13:06] Trina: yez
[21/4/19, 22:13:50] Yi Hein: Alright thanks for the advice!
[21/4/19, 22:14:19] Trina: nppppp
[22/4/19, 21:59:22] Yi Hein: this is actually amazing...it captures a phenomenon I experienced exactly into words
[22/4/19, 21:59:58] Yi Hein: realised I've managed to doublethink my way in SSEF to get a bronze
[22/4/19, 22:02:36] Yi Hein: accepting the inherent critical flaws in my research project and yet intentionally forgetting it, focusing on the facts that fit into the 'story', then still wholeheartedly believing in the story to the extent that I was able to present it passionately with excitement (to the point I forgot abt ignoring the inherent flaws in the project)
[22/4/19, 22:13:12] Trina: MIND GAMES YOOooooooooo
[22/4/19, 22:13:14] Trina: it work
[22/4/19, 22:15:53] Yi Hein: idk what does being sincere and genuine mean anymore...especially if one can psyche himself to think of lies as truths
[22/4/19, 22:17:15] Trina: That's why AFTER that u have to reverse the doublethink
[22/4/19, 22:17:35] Yi Hein: Huh
[22/4/19, 22:17:58] Trina: After SSEF remind urself that "ya lol this project is not that gd"
[22/4/19, 22:18:19] Yi Hein: Hahahaha yeah
[22/4/19, 22:18:42] Yi Hein: just realise how pervasive it is in my life
[22/4/19, 22:18:42] Trina: BOOM then u win @ life
[22/4/19, 22:19:01] Yi Hein: Seems so unethical
[22/4/19, 22:19:06] Trina: Just think of it as ""best version of urself""""
[22/4/19, 22:19:08] Trina: LOLOL
[22/4/19, 22:20:02] Yi Hein: Tbh I might have doublethinked myself in BMT too, but resulted in losing myself
[22/4/19, 22:20:22] Trina: O my what u mean
[22/4/19, 22:22:21] Yi Hein: In BMT I tried my best to help others out and take one for the team for like guard duties and stuff...but then I questioned myself whether I'm doing it because I genuinely care abt my BMT-mates for cos I wanna get a good peer review
[22/4/19, 22:22:46] Yi Hein: I was really confused so I psyched myself to think that I genuinely care for them
[22/4/19, 22:22:59] Trina: :0
[22/4/19, 22:23:08] Trina: Ok at least u reflected
[22/4/19, 22:23:11] Trina: WISDOM
[22/4/19, 22:23:50] Yi Hein: But then I realise some actions I did was quite selfish so maybe idk...I'm not as altruistic as I thought I was
[22/4/19, 22:23:56] Yi Hein: Hahaha yeah
[22/4/19, 22:24:10] Trina: Is it sth u fee u need to change
[22/4/19, 22:24:25] Trina: If yes then just change it lah haha make a conscious choice to do so
[22/4/19, 22:25:00] Yi Hein: Idk man
[22/4/19, 22:25:47] Trina: FEEL*
[22/4/19, 22:26:37] Yi Hein: Honestly idk which version is my true self lol
[22/4/19, 22:26:43] Yi Hein: Army makes me think of weird things
[22/4/19, 22:26:47] Yi Hein: HAHHAHA
[22/4/19, 22:26:55] Yi Hein: But isn't by changing it one would become not yourself but a facade of what you want to be
[22/4/19, 22:26:59] Trina: EMPTY MIND=DEVIL WORKSHOP
[22/4/19, 22:27:14] Trina: no that's self improvement 😤👏🏻
[22/4/19, 22:28:38] Yi Hein: But every person  has natural tendencies right
[22/4/19, 22:29:05] Trina: Some of which r not that gd so shd b changed
[22/4/19, 22:29:10] Trina: N that's ok
[22/4/19, 22:30:21] Yi Hein: Like a person may revert back to the natural tendencies at critical situations, which I had viewed as a crack in the facade
[22/4/19, 22:30:42] Trina: I see what u mean
[22/4/19, 22:30:54] Trina: But I don't think of self improvement as a facade leh
[22/4/19, 22:31:15] Trina: Eh I think most ppl are inherently selfish bc of the need to self preserve
[22/4/19, 22:31:23] Trina: But they make the active choice to put others first
[22/4/19, 22:31:37] Trina: That's not rly a facade is it
[22/4/19, 22:32:12] Trina: Ofc at times when your mettle is tested u will revert to the easy choice (i.e. Of being self serving)
[22/4/19, 22:32:28] Trina: But that makes your active decision to be selfless more admirable
[22/4/19, 22:32:33] Trina: Bc it's not the easy choice
[22/4/19, 22:32:55] Yi Hein: That's actly sth I never considered
[22/4/19, 22:34:02] Yi Hein: I like how you and spin things ard and it sounds better HAHAHA
[22/4/19, 22:34:08] Yi Hein: *can
[22/4/19, 22:34:19] Trina: YEH
‎[22/4/19, 22:35:12] Trina: ‎GIF omitted
[22/4/19, 22:35:25] Yi Hein: Idk on certain level I still feel that this is not geniuine on the deepest level
[22/4/19, 22:36:03] Yi Hein: Hahahaha very appropriate
[22/4/19, 22:36:08] Trina: I think I get what u mean
[22/4/19, 22:36:26] Trina: Like if u have to make an effort to be a certain type of person then it's not real alr
[22/4/19, 22:37:03] Trina: Mayb another way to look at it is that someone's character and personality is not fixed? It's sth that evolves w personal growth
[22/4/19, 22:37:51] Yi Hein: Hahaha yeah sth I considered too, lemarkian vs Darwinian perspectives
[22/4/19, 22:39:26] Yi Hein: also you know a Long time ago, I told you whether I experienced a situation where someone doesn't like you (being unkind) but I don't know why?
[22/4/19, 22:39:34] Trina: oooo ya I rmbr
[22/4/19, 22:40:51] Yi Hein: I realised a pattern, first time was during night firing, it was 2am, second time was during field camp, where everyone is dying in the heat and completed wasted
[22/4/19, 22:41:09] Trina: Mhm??
[22/4/19, 22:42:19] Yi Hein: Perhaps this demonstrates the natural tendencies of humanity?
[22/4/19, 22:42:35] Yi Hein: shown during the toughest times
[22/4/19, 22:42:41] Yi Hein: Idk if it's true then it's quite sad
[22/4/19, 22:42:44] Trina: Of you or the guy
[22/4/19, 22:43:26] Trina: Not sure abt whether u r saying he's difficult to work with when things get difficult or that u r more impatient when things get difficult
[22/4/19, 22:43:29] Yi Hein: It was what I observed from others, like almost everyone during that period
[22/4/19, 22:43:35] Trina: 😫😫CONFUSE
[22/4/19, 22:44:16] Yi Hein: The former, and it's not a person it's pretty much everyone
[22/4/19, 22:44:39] Trina: Wait gimme 1 sec I need to connect my wifi
[22/4/19, 22:44:47] Trina: JUST continue saying whatever first
[22/4/19, 22:45:22] Trina: It's normal lah
[22/4/19, 22:45:32] Trina: Stressful situations will bring out the worst in ppl
[22/4/19, 22:46:49] Yi Hein: yeah true
[22/4/19, 22:47:40] Yi Hein: do you believe ppl are innately good though
[22/4/19, 22:47:56] Trina: The thing is good is hard to define
[22/4/19, 22:49:02] Trina: But inherently selfish yes
[22/4/19, 22:49:09] Yi Hein: you can take good has altruism
[22/4/19, 22:49:13] Yi Hein: *as
[22/4/19, 22:49:51] Trina: No I think ppl are innately selfish, but their behaviour will drift to altruism when they realise it benefits them (even indirectly)
[22/4/19, 22:50:30] Yi Hein: hmmm how would altruism benefit them
[22/4/19, 22:50:54] Trina: Ok super far fetched but imagine caveman times
[22/4/19, 22:51:53] Trina: A caveman person will agree to do X altruistic act (e.g. Take care of cave children/give someone shelter in the rain) for the benefit which is 1. Act will be reciprocated 2. Preserving of peace (global benefit)
[22/4/19, 22:54:14] Trina: Hm and ok this is also an extreme and maybe irrelevant example but I think when we think abt dying we usually feel sad bc we are going to lose a person impt to US but we think less abt how scary and lonely it can b for the dying person
[22/4/19, 22:54:44] Yi Hein: reciprocated to the caveman mentioned or others?
[22/4/19, 22:54:58] Yi Hein: why is it scary and lonely to die?
[22/4/19, 22:55:24] Trina: Caveman
[22/4/19, 22:56:12] Trina: IS IT NOT? I think it is.. a very isolating experience...... and a scary one bc u 1. Leaving your loved ones behind 2. Not sure of what happens next 3. Most likely HECKIN SICK N in pain
[22/4/19, 22:57:18] Yi Hein: idk never really saw it that way hahaha
[22/4/19, 22:58:15] Yi Hein: Maybe I had mugged the outsider for too many hours
[22/4/19, 22:58:28] Trina: LOOOL
[22/4/19, 22:59:27] Yi Hein: i don't think I'll feel scared or fearful...it's just sth that happens
[22/4/19, 22:59:53] Trina: Hopefully one day I'll get to that stage man
[22/4/19, 23:00:07] Yi Hein: Hahahaha
[22/4/19, 23:00:28] Yi Hein: Yun ye passed on her wisdom to me LOOOL
[22/4/19, 23:00:37] Yi Hein: She's actually Meursault
[22/4/19, 23:00:50] Trina: O SHIT u mean her status
[22/4/19, 23:00:52] Trina: HAHAHAH
[22/4/19, 23:01:01] Yi Hein: wait what's her status
[22/4/19, 23:01:00] Trina: I was mind boggled when I read it
[22/4/19, 23:01:25] Trina: Death does not concern us, because as long as we exist, death is not here. And when it does come, we no longer exist.
[22/4/19, 23:02:07] Yi Hein: Oh yeah that makes sense coming from her
[22/4/19, 23:02:17] Yi Hein: She says she relates to meursault entirely
[22/4/19, 23:02:28] Yi Hein: So I was asking her to interpret the book for me hahahaha
[22/4/19, 23:02:36] Trina: HAHAHHHaha omg
[22/4/19, 23:02:58] Trina: I mean. It's VALID???
[22/4/19, 23:03:05] Trina: Wild
[22/4/19, 23:03:37] Yi Hein: let's say if (touch a million tonnes of wood) you die tmr, would you feel scared?
[22/4/19, 23:03:48] Trina: If I knew? YEA
[22/4/19, 23:03:52] Trina: If I didn't? NAH
[22/4/19, 23:03:59] Trina: HOW specifically
[22/4/19, 23:04:02] Yi Hein: HAHHAA ofc
[22/4/19, 23:04:03] Trina: Is someone gna stab me
[22/4/19, 23:04:09] Trina: THAT WOULD BE SCARY NGL
[22/4/19, 23:04:14] Trina: If I get hit by a car
[22/4/19, 23:04:17] Trina: Ok la I won't even know
[22/4/19, 23:04:23] Trina: I'm blind anyways
[22/4/19, 23:04:39] Yi Hein: Nah like Insta death, like someone enters the kill command into the 'life console'
[22/4/19, 23:04:55] Trina: If it's instant then not scary what
[22/4/19, 23:04:58] Trina: I wouldn't even know
[22/4/19, 23:05:29] Yi Hein: Yeah lol
[22/4/19, 23:06:38] Yi Hein: Posed the same qn to my BMT section mates (in the middle of the forest), and they all said they can't bare to die so young
[22/4/19, 23:07:02] Trina: What kind of existential crisis r u trying to induce
[22/4/19, 23:07:04] Yi Hein: *bear
[22/4/19, 23:07:09] Trina: In the MIDDLE OF THE FOREST
[22/4/19, 23:07:10] Yi Hein: HAHHAHA
[22/4/19, 23:08:20] Yi Hein: just army thoughts...when one has reached a primal state of surviving, a sudden existential crisis occurs
[22/4/19, 23:08:40] Trina: That's damn sad ok
[22/4/19, 23:08:42] Yi Hein: Jk lah it's just a random thought haha
[22/4/19, 23:10:20] Yi Hein: Tbh I don't think I'll mind, cos like since everyone is going to die anyway, so kind of view things ppl do in life as a bonus
[22/4/19, 23:10:43] Yi Hein: Which also amounts to nothing at the end of it
[22/4/19, 23:10:45] Trina: OMG YI HEIN r u going mad in the army
[22/4/19, 23:11:15] Yi Hein: Hahahaha
[22/4/19, 23:11:31] Yi Hein: I guess that's the problem without religion, you think of weird stuff like this
[22/4/19, 23:11:49] Trina: Oya that's tru I guess
[22/4/19, 23:12:49] Yi Hein: Are u existentialist then?
[22/4/19, 23:13:09] Trina: What does it mean exactly
[22/4/19, 23:13:17] Trina: Nothing in life has meaning?
[22/4/19, 23:14:32] Trina: Oh individual choice and experience
[22/4/19, 23:14:46] Yi Hein: Life is innately meaningless but one can create their own meaning in life
[22/4/19, 23:14:51] Trina: HM idek leh m just gna live it 😔🔫
[22/4/19, 23:15:25] Yi Hein: Hahaha thats the spirit
[22/4/19, 23:15:33] Yi Hein: trinalist
[22/4/19, 23:15:44] Yi Hein: You own school of thought
[22/4/19, 23:15:53] Trina: Hahaha

[24/4/19, 22:19:06] Trina: Next wk!!!!!!!!
[24/4/19, 22:20:16] Yi Hein: Most of everyone here is a 90 rank pointer 😲
[24/4/19, 22:20:27] Trina: YA so many 90 RP?!?
[24/4/19, 22:20:37] Trina: Raffles like 1/4 iirc
[24/4/19, 22:21:06] Trina: Is 45=90??????
[24/4/19, 22:21:52] Yi Hein: For my section, only got ppl from AC, Hwa Chong, RI
[24/4/19, 22:21:58] Yi Hein: Elitist as heck
[24/4/19, 22:22:13] Trina: WATTttytt
[24/4/19, 22:22:24] Yi Hein: 45 is actly harder, based on numbers
[24/4/19, 22:22:32] Trina: _"NS is for social mixing"_
[24/4/19, 22:22:53] Trina: IKR like I think the ppl I knew who got 90RP are not smarter than the ppl I knew who got 45 leh
[24/4/19, 22:23:08] Trina: But this kinda anecdotal reasoning is..,,. dubious
[24/4/19, 22:23:49] Yi Hein: Lol how do you determine whether they're smarter
[24/4/19, 22:24:04] Trina: CAN TELL PLS
[24/4/19, 22:24:17] Yi Hein: X-ray eyes
[24/4/19, 22:24:39] Trina: Yez
[24/4/19, 22:25:42] Yi Hein: this whole system in SAF is pretty screwed up, inequality to the max
[24/4/19, 22:26:43] Yi Hein: ppl in OCS are generally:
1. From an elite school
2. Rich
3. Good family background
4. Chinese
[24/4/19, 22:27:16] Trina: That's just the way it is :/ what to do
[24/4/19, 22:27:39] Trina: I assume the people doing the selections r also
[24/4/19, 22:27:51] Yi Hein: I'll wait for you to change the policies hahaha
[24/4/19, 22:28:22] Trina: PLS
[24/4/19, 22:30:14] Yi Hein: It's really sheltered, never really interacted with anyone outside of that bubble
[24/4/19, 22:31:15] Trina: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz idek alr
[24/4/19, 22:32:44] Yi Hein: With that being said, there's quite a lot of mugging so sort of make sense why they choose 90 RP
[24/4/19, 22:33:42] Trina: I guess 🤷‍♀
[24/4/19, 22:34:11] Yi Hein: Oh yeah and Dylan got waitlisted and sean didn't get interview for NTU

[24/4/19, 22:36:26] Yi Hein: Ohhhhh yeah that may make sense

[24/4/19, 22:37:40] Yi Hein: my section mate didn't get NTU reply either and apparently it's cos they need to verify he's not a criminal

[3/5/19, 21:50:56] Yi Hein: Honestly regardless
[3/5/19, 21:51:26] Yi Hein: Thanks so much for helping me throughout this journey :) from re-writing my ps for me to editing countless drafts
[3/5/19, 21:51:50] Yi Hein: Couldn't have ask for a better friend to journey through this phase of my life :)
[3/5/19, 21:51:58] Trina: dont even WORRY abt it
[3/5/19, 21:52:12] Trina: always welcome
[3/5/19, 21:52:58] Yi Hein: LEGIT THANKS
[3/5/19, 21:56:39] Yi Hein: Sometimes it's difficult to describe the emotion, perhaps it's a sense of immense gratefulness, and for the many people in my life that have helped me, and on one hand I feel I totally don't deserve the help, but on the other hand, it enables me to (perhaps naively) believe in the innate kindness in humanity...which spurs me on the many things I do. Really Glad you're one of those who've made a significant impact  and I'll definitely pay your kindness forward to others 😊
[3/5/19, 21:57:07] Trina: U

[3/5/19, 22:01:59] Yi Hein: But don't think I'll ever give up on Med...just don't know whether it's worth it to chase sth that I may not be cut out for
[3/5/19, 22:02:04] Yi Hein: HAHAHAHA
[3/5/19, 22:02:25] Trina: u have all the time in the world to think abt it

‎[4/5/19, 00:11:35] Yi Hein: ‎image omitted
[4/5/19, 00:11:44] Yi Hein: No wait list, didn't know I was that shit
[4/5/19, 00:12:49] Trina: no waitlist one
[4/5/19, 00:12:49] Trina: NUS no waitlist
[4/5/19, 00:13:03] Trina: they just say u r rejected
[4/5/19, 00:13:07] Trina: if got more spaces they might let u in
[4/5/19, 00:13:21] Yi Hein: Ah ok
[4/5/19, 00:13:51] Yi Hein: Kinda hurts tbh
[4/5/19, 00:13:58] Yi Hein: I Guess it's been a goal for too Long
[4/5/19, 00:14:09] Trina: :(
[4/5/19, 00:14:26] Trina: honestly NUS is blind not to take u lah
[4/5/19, 00:14:45] Trina: u will succeed anywhere dont fret abt this. u r gd human
[4/5/19, 00:15:03] Yi Hein: Idk man
[4/5/19, 00:15:17] Yi Hein: Suddenly feel so lost
[4/5/19, 00:15:53] Trina: this is just a chance to think abt what u want!!!!! is ok
[4/5/19, 00:16:05] Trina: if its not med = great at least u know BEFORE u get in
[4/5/19, 00:16:14] Trina: if it is med = u r now surer of it
[4/5/19, 00:16:16] Trina: win-win
[4/5/19, 00:24:53] Yi Hein: Feel like it's particularly difficult, of all the things I'm not good at, I used to find comfort in what others said - that I'll become a good doctor to be able to help others. And perhaps no matter how much I fail this can be something I can excel in. And I kinda truly believed in it, cos I feel my strengths are suited for it. But now, idk whether my strength is a strength after all. Perhaps over the years I believed so firmly that I'm a good fit to become a doctor and it became something rather intergral, but when I'm now told that I'm not cut out for it, it feels so weird
[4/5/19, 00:25:00] Yi Hein: Soz it's just ramblings lol
[4/5/19, 00:26:06] Trina: get what u mean :(
[4/5/19, 00:27:00] Yi Hein: Claudia didn't get both NTU and NUs either, 45 pointer too :(((
[4/5/19, 00:27:09] Yi Hein: Rather tragic tbh
[4/5/19, 00:27:15] Trina: :0
[4/5/19, 00:27:19] Trina: wth they want??
[4/5/19, 00:27:53] Yi Hein: Yeah that's the scary part...even if I do re-apply, what makes me think that it'll be anything different from tdy
[4/5/19, 00:28:15] Trina: it's the FSA/SJT only right
[4/5/19, 00:28:22] Trina: they dc about grades after shortlisting
[4/5/19, 00:28:27] Yi Hein: Yeah
[4/5/19, 00:28:38] Trina: i can probs guess why
[4/5/19, 00:28:48] Trina: yall r too humble
[4/5/19, 00:29:10] Yi Hein: what do you mean?
[4/5/19, 00:29:23] Trina: think interviews r about selling yourself
[4/5/19, 00:29:54] Trina: u can have done 100000 hours of volunteering and stuff but if u cant package ur achievements they wont know what u did
[4/5/19, 00:30:28] Yi Hein: I mean it's all in the application
[4/5/19, 00:30:40] Yi Hein: There's limited amount of time in the interview too
[4/5/19, 00:30:50] Trina: tru
[4/5/19, 00:31:38] Yi Hein: The talks I went for the most common advice is...be yourself / geniuine

[4/5/19, 09:30:07] Trina: _go home prepare documents and see patient in court_
[4/5/19, 09:30:11] Yi Hein: hahahaha

[4/5/19, 09:32:17] Trina: M not even going for sure
[4/5/19, 09:32:22] Yi Hein: LOLOOOOLL
[4/5/19, 09:32:28] Trina: "Will make someone else happy I guess@
[4/5/19, 09:32:32] Trina: OOKKKKK
[4/5/19, 09:32:34] Trina: HAHAHAHAH
[4/5/19, 09:32:39] Yi Hein: yeah lol
[4/5/19, 09:33:12] Trina: HONESTLY shd I do med
[4/5/19, 09:33:30] Yi Hein: DILEMMA TIME AGAIN
[4/5/19, 09:33:38] Yi Hein: do you see yourself as a doctor?
[4/5/19, 09:33:39] Trina: Ya :/

[4/5/19, 09:34:37] Trina: Dying hard
[4/5/19, 09:34:41] Trina: I have 20 days
[4/5/19, 09:34:42] Trina: WTH
[4/5/19, 09:35:01] Yi Hein: yup sleepless nights shall be a thing now

[4/5/19, 09:35:25] Trina: Need COG now
[4/5/19, 09:35:28] Trina: 😤😤
[4/5/19, 09:35:28] Yi Hein: hahahaha
[4/5/19, 09:35:57] Trina: How ah
[4/5/19, 09:36:02] Trina: TIME 2 DIE
[4/5/19, 09:36:09] Yi Hein: what's the biggest consideration for not doing med
[4/5/19, 09:36:16] Trina: Bad at sci
[4/5/19, 09:36:17] Trina: LOL
[4/5/19, 09:36:42] Trina: Cannot do sth more lit based
[4/5/19, 09:36:46] Trina: That's basically it
[4/5/19, 09:37:23] Yi Hein: honestly i don't think that's an issue, the professor I interned with hated the sciences
[4/5/19, 09:37:34] Yi Hein: but went into research eventually which was ironic
[4/5/19, 09:37:41] Yi Hein: he saw research as directing a movie
[4/5/19, 09:37:46] Yi Hein: which is rather true
[4/5/19, 09:38:02] Yi Hein: how to present a story from different persepctive
[4/5/19, 09:38:24] Trina: That's tru.. I just think that the problem is time and time again when I get to CHOOSE sth I wanna do eg EE or sth I don't wanna do sci
[4/5/19, 09:38:50] Trina: And the reason I got accepted was definitely not bc I had research/sci stuff in my CV..
[4/5/19, 09:38:59] Trina: (Because I literally have 0)
[4/5/19, 09:39:22] Trina: If I hav extra time I am 100% not doing anything sci related
[4/5/19, 09:39:41] Yi Hein: hahahaha
[4/5/19, 09:39:47] Trina: It's not sth I want to read up on in my free time HENCE I conclude I only study it bc I need it for grades
[4/5/19, 09:40:15] Yi Hein: talk to more ppl about it lol
[4/5/19, 09:40:23] Yi Hein: don't think i'm in a position to give you advice haha
[4/5/19, 09:40:39] Trina: I will but WWHY
[4/5/19, 09:40:58] Trina: Value ur opinion anyways
[4/5/19, 09:41:53] Yi Hein: ok for me, i just feel that for law, while oxford law is amazing, but if you're not gonna practise as a lawyer, doing med and practising as a doctor seems to be a brighter path for you
[4/5/19, 09:42:13] Yi Hein: but the problem is that you'll have to deal with a massive amount of content that you're not interested in
[4/5/19, 09:42:19] Yi Hein: but perhaps you'll find interest in it along the way
[4/5/19, 09:42:25] Yi Hein: as what happened to the professor
[4/5/19, 09:42:37] Trina: TRUUUUUUUUUUU
[4/5/19, 09:44:44] Yi Hein: also would be nice if you could give me free mcs
[4/5/19, 09:44:45] Yi Hein: HAHAHAHA
[4/5/19, 09:47:03] Yi Hein: ultimately for me, i don't believe in the work-life balance, I believe in life-life balance, to be able to love your job so much that it's your life, so either med or law, you should choose the things which you know you'll love doing for the significant portion of your life
[4/5/19, 09:48:26] Trina: I 100% agreeeeeeee
[4/5/19, 09:48:48] Trina: Problem is I would be happy doing either
[4/5/19, 09:48:50] Trina: KILLMEPLS
[4/5/19, 09:48:59] Trina: Need to REFLECT
[4/5/19, 09:49:18] Yi Hein: no more doublethink haha
[4/5/19, 09:49:29] Trina: Ya :((((
[4/5/19, 09:50:03] Yi Hein: i just hope whatever choice you make, you'll be happy with it and won't look back and life a meaningful life :)
[4/5/19, 09:50:08] Yi Hein: *live

[5/5/19, 15:30:30] Yi Hein: Hey trina can I send you details on what I did during the interview and help me see what you've done differently/what I can improve on?
[5/5/19, 15:31:46] Yi Hein: wanna learn from this experience and hopefully next year would be better
[5/5/19, 16:22:07] Trina: cannn I reply u later tho
[5/5/19, 16:22:16] Trina: out w family soz
[5/5/19, 16:22:32] Yi Hein: Yeah sure
[5/5/19, 19:48:27] Yi Hein: *Group Station*
- tried to speak up as much as possible 
- offered my opinion when I felt the direction the group was heading wasn't logical
- one person suggested taking one item but I felt it didn't make sense so I counter-suggested and explained why we shouldn't take it and the group agreed and we moved on
- after the surprise change (must swap out items), we didn't catch the instructions cos the doctor had a strong accent, so we didn't know we had to swap out the items, we thought we had a choice
- there was a point in time where I tried to speak but someone else was speaking to another person so there was two conversations, a bit messy
- for the QnA, I explained the choice logically but didn't speak for very long 
- the last qna qn I got was what can be improved on, I talked about staying calm after the change but didn't speak for very Long either
- overall the group was quite wholesome, there wasn't any arguments

*Personal Statement Station*
- asked about why medicine, I started explaining about loving science but before I could elaborate on the more human aspects, I got cut off
- asked about interaction with patients in medical field, but I felt like I went out of topic and didn't answer her question directly
- I was passionate about medicine so I spoke rather excitedly (and did say I was passionate about it), but not sure whether they thought it was fake
- asked about weaknesses, told them frankly about being not confident at times
- asked about healthcare problems, told them about the patient confidentiality incident but she seemed confused, I moved on to talk about rising healthcare costs and diabetes
- talked about internship, she asked why I would have done differently from Doctors, I said spend more time with patients
- asked why you? I said she didn't have to choose me, but it'll allow me to pursue this passion of mine and make a difference in lives of others (felt it was too boastful qn for me)
- asked about strength/weakness again, I feel like I stuttered a lot and then the time ended

*Convince HR Hire Mentally impaired*
- tried to convince the person by thinking from her perspective, about how it would benefit her company, to see the positives about hiring the mentally impaired 
- when asked about whether I'll accept lower pay, I said I haven't discussed with them and need to ask, but I feel if they can do the same work they should be paid the same

*IPPT Cheat*
- totally forgot this was an ethics station
- didn't explicitly say that what he was doing was wrong, but tried to guide him to reason that it was wrong, cos I feel if he derives the answer on his own it would be more impactful
- tried to suggest other things he can do to earn money
- reasoned with him on why it was wrong, regardless whether he gets caught or not

*Stress Test Station*
- remained calm throughout, like took the time to think and strategies and did the things properly can carefully, didn't panic
- but I showed a bit of frustration when the bolt kept falling

Overall: I felt that I did ok, a few screw ups here and there, but felt that I did what I wanted to do

*SJT:*
- felt like a screwed this one up massively, so unsure which factors to prioritise, eg. Respecting seniority vs time etc. Realised that some answers I change and differ by an entire spectrum 
- honestly unsure for most, both spectrums seemed ok, so some just put an answer that I felt the slightest inclination to
[5/5/19, 23:18:25] Trina: Tbh idk I don't think my feedback is indicative of anything tbh but ok my 2c:

Group: seems ok? Idek how much weight is given to this station.. maybe it's just to weed out the ppl who are exceedingly uncooperative and no EQ so u shd be ok la

PS: maybe this one was a problem since she cut u off/didn't understand what u were saying? Also I think must rmbr that these are quite jaded doctors so if u go in glorifying med too much they might be scared of letting u in (too idealistic)

-HR: seems ok? Also other than "benefits to company" another possible angle is that discrimination is wrong as a matter of principle. Idk how to comment on the role play bc I think a lot also goes to the way sth is being said rather than content alone so watch body language and tone

IPPT: again content is ok but idk abt other factors. Since station is short I think it might be better to be direct and explicit in highlighting why u think sth is wrong in interest of time

Stress: sounds ok also. Most imptly show u r unfazed lah

SJT: think u know this might be the issue? Being unsure is normal but I think the problem is SJT is hard to prep for :/ it's just difficult to change personal thought processes... but I think there were (at least for me) quite clear yes/no options. Since the scale was 1-4 iirc what I did was break it down to 50-50 lah. So if I think it is an ok ans it is either a 1/2, and if it is not then 3/4. Then go one step ahead and say ok but is this BAD or RLY BAD to decide btn 3 and 4..
[5/5/19, 23:22:02] Trina: SJT from the sample qns I gathered that they were quite realistic in terms of the answers they were looking for- so u are not expected to be an angel (100% self-sacrificing, Christ-embodying figure). What I mean by realistic is eg the question they gave in the sample abt seeing a colleague struggling w too much work while being on your way to leave the hospital for a concert. Iirc they didn't expect u to say "ILL DROP MY CONCERT AND HELP HER! IM AN ANGEL IDC ABT MONEY I CARE ABT MY COMRADE 😤😤😤" , they also accepted it if you said it was ok to look for another colleague to step in so 1. She gets help 2. You get to leave work
[5/5/19, 23:31:02] Trina: Not rly qualified to give any advice since I'm not an interviewer (so idrk what they want tbh) but if I had to give any advice it would be to 
1. Be enthusiastic BUT realistic in your perception of the medical career (the difficulties, the long hours, ungrateful patients, uncooperative teammates etc) and know that while things may not always go smoothly it's OK and part and parcel of doctoring
2. Think there is a need to show u have the capacity to think clearly and be calm so it helps if u consciously manage ur body language (speak slowly and clearly... look interviewer in eye.. SMILE... take nothing as a personal criticism but use qns as an opportunity to demonstrate ur abilities.. etc)
3. Ya in the acting stations I think how u present yourself is as impt or if not MORE impt than what u say. Eg: small stuff like showing u are listening by nodding or whatevs, acknowledging their viewpoint before giving yours, if it's a sad scenario make sure u are not standoffish (eg don't fold arms etc), lean in etc tbh idek lol
4. Sth I found useful was rmbring the doctors have likely been there since like 8am-7pm so they are SICK AND TIRED as shit of hearing the textbook answers. So just be bubbly, try to be funny if u can (ok might not be the best advice for ppl if they are jittery and can't pull it off). Ultimately they r human and who doesn't like funny stoof..a large % of being a gd doc is abt how well u connect with others after all
[5/5/19, 23:31:10] Trina: Ok that's it I think
[5/5/19, 23:33:36] Trina: Oya and also I think it's pretty... zzz to (if they ask) say I wanna be a NEUROLOGIST! OBGYN IS LIFE! those kinda stuff if u alr KNOW that they want generalists. I fell back on the ez (but tru) answer that I would do geriatrics bc I like old peeps..,, v cute
[6/5/19, 01:50:08] Yi Hein: Thanks so much for typing this out and really appreciate your advice
[6/5/19, 01:55:18] Yi Hein: Reading through I feel that there isn't anything in particular I did badly, that attitude I adopted was rather similar to what you mentioned. Perhaps it's the small things that add up to the overall score
[6/5/19, 01:57:16] Yi Hein: Or that my SJT score was so Low that I got red flagged?
[6/5/19, 01:58:51] Yi Hein: Did you used the foundational Programme practise questions?
[6/5/19, 02:03:04] Yi Hein: For SJT, the attitude I adopted was always patient first, do whatever it takes to maximise patient welfare, so the questions that touched on this is quite clear cut for me. But many of the questions tended to focus more on myself and my colleagues, like whether I'll get embarrassed or overstep authority...which is honestly difficult to answer cos I was tempted to rate it as not important at all (since I honestly don't care whether I get embarrassed/make my colleague embarrassed if it helps the patient)
[6/5/19, 02:20:33] Yi Hein: Honestly a bit hard for me to see what is realistic, if you ask me what I'll do irl when faced with the situation, I'll realistically be willing to drop a concert to Ensure patient welfare...well (since my life is a FSA/SJT in itself) it's happened irl before in Y4, dropped a movie with my friends to help out at a Polyclinic
[6/5/19, 02:24:46] Yi Hein: I'm starting to think that results of Med interviews are separated by fine margins, and it's the little things that make the difference, and these little things are made on the basis of one's personality/character. While Med interview tips help, there's little I can do to change my personality...if they feel that it doesn't fit, then I can't do much cos it's who I am 🤷🏻‍♂️
[6/5/19, 02:29:02] Yi Hein: On the bright side, one encouraging thing is that my parents said they'll be willing to fund me overseas, which means I'll just apply everywhere and I don't have to place all my bets on LCK scholarship which is basically impossible to get
[6/5/19, 07:48:00] Trina: Dk how they even score it man lolol dodgy
[6/5/19, 07:48:12] Trina: I didn't prep for it..,,
[6/5/19, 07:49:00] Trina: Think I personally put authority as q impt and not embarrassing colleagues as q impt
[6/5/19, 07:49:25] Trina: Woohoo!
[6/5/19, 10:08:26] Yi Hein: Ah ok
[9/5/19, 13:22:45] Trina: PSC REJECTED :(
[11/5/19, 18:34:34] Yi Hein: Sflr was in the jungle
[11/5/19, 18:34:46] Yi Hein: 😥
[11/5/19, 18:35:04] Yi Hein: So how does this affect you Med vs law dilemma?

[12/5/19, 13:00:42] Trina: ARGHGgghgg
[12/5/19, 13:03:06] Yi Hein: ok for my opinion, the main point of Uni is to prep you for your career, so it makes more sense to go to the Uni which will gear you to the career you love more...which in this case should be Med? Honestly after entering the profession, ppl would look more at job performance rather than Uni you went to
[12/5/19, 13:03:34] Yi Hein: So for me, it's go for Med
[12/5/19, 13:03:45] Yi Hein: Gonna be real hard to reject Oxford if you actually do though
[12/5/19, 13:03:58] Trina: Ya lor that's what I thought.. plus idk if without an extreme inclination for law is it worth paying 145k more
[12/5/19, 13:04:04] Trina: IKR
[12/5/19, 13:04:36] Trina: BUT what I have convinced myself is this: oxford is once in a lifetime blabla
[12/5/19, 13:04:52] Trina: But isn't med also LOL tbh any of these are once in a lifetime AND life changing so
[12/5/19, 13:05:31] Yi Hein: Oxford is for 3 years, your career until retirement lol - 40-50 years?

[12/5/19, 13:49:10] Trina: ARGH ikr
[12/5/19, 13:49:23] Trina: But same the other way
[12/5/19, 13:50:01] Trina: When I'm losing a case/having to be client mouthpiece - I'll be wondering why not just have done med.. suk it up.. do sth secure
[12/5/19, 13:51:41] Trina: A lot to lose either way
[12/5/19, 13:55:48] Yi Hein: Yeah true

[15/5/19, 22:40:07] Yi Hein: The aptitude part can practice to become faster
[15/5/19, 22:40:15] Yi Hein: The science part just mug
[15/5/19, 22:40:21] Trina: OMG i forgot that part existed
[15/5/19, 22:40:21] Yi Hein: Which I didn't for my first attempt

[15/5/19, 22:43:19] Trina: doesnt take much to reach the limits of my physics knowledge
[15/5/19, 22:43:41] Yi Hein: Hahahaaha

[15/5/19, 22:45:06] Trina: is my plain incompetence at MATH
[15/5/19, 22:45:53] Yi Hein: actly same for me, I think it's more of critical thinking and problem solving
[15/5/19, 22:45:59] Yi Hein: Sth I really need to improve on
[15/5/19, 22:46:17] Yi Hein: Which is what math honestly is

‎[18/5/19, 14:26:13] Trina: ‎sticker omitted

[18/5/19, 14:27:46] Trina: THE SJAB KID
[18/5/19, 14:27:51] Trina: I know the CATCH kid story
[18/5/19, 14:28:54] Yi Hein: I was addressing the entire faction (basically cadets are split into factions and sleep in the same bunk)
[18/5/19, 14:29:32] Yi Hein: It was stand-by bunk, basically area inspection to make sure the bunk is clean
[18/5/19, 14:30:27] Yi Hein: Then me and isaiah was just scolding then cos (can't rly rmb but i think) the cupboard was dirty

[18/5/19, 14:31:29] Trina: I'm anti UG
[18/5/19, 14:31:33] Trina: 🤢🤢
[18/5/19, 14:31:41] Trina: Nasty
[18/5/19, 14:31:46] Yi Hein: I'm anti army
[18/5/19, 14:31:55] Trina: LOLOLOL
[18/5/19, 14:32:08] Trina: Is the brainwashing working
[18/5/19, 14:32:18] Trina: When become Singaporean??!?! 😔✌🏻
[18/5/19, 14:32:31] Yi Hein: Hahahaha
[18/5/19, 14:32:42] Trina: 🤧🤧🤧
[18/5/19, 14:32:57] Yi Hein: why would NS want me to become singaporean though
[18/5/19, 14:33:16] Trina: Suffer so much alr. Patriotic
[18/5/19, 14:33:27] Trina: This is my country 😤😤😤🤙🏻👏🏻
[18/5/19, 14:34:03] Yi Hein: you are patriotic?
[18/5/19, 14:34:19] Trina: 8/10
[18/5/19, 14:34:34] Trina: -2 for the aunties that push me in the MRT
[18/5/19, 14:34:37] Yi Hein: interesting
[18/5/19, 14:34:38] Trina: make me hate sg
[18/5/19, 14:34:43] Yi Hein: HAHAHAHA
[18/5/19, 14:35:25] Yi Hein: What makes you patriotic though?
[18/5/19, 14:35:53] Trina: Sg nice enough
[18/5/19, 14:36:11] Yi Hein: so you want to protect it?
[18/5/19, 14:36:49] Trina: NOT MILITARILY
[18/5/19, 14:36:57] Trina: I'll just.. err take care of its ppl ok
[18/5/19, 14:37:02] Trina: IDW GO ARMY PLSPLSS
[18/5/19, 14:37:58] Yi Hein: Ah I see
[18/5/19, 14:38:36] Yi Hein: I've never felt nationalistic sentiments, and feel like it's the basis of war - prioritising national interests
[18/5/19, 14:39:50] Trina: Ah but patriotism is not nationalism
[18/5/19, 14:39:58] Trina: Nationalism is the dangerous one
[18/5/19, 14:40:14] Yi Hein: what's the diff haha never took history
[18/5/19, 14:40:24] Trina: Patriotism is "I LOVE SG"
[18/5/19, 14:40:59] Trina: Nationalism is "I LOVE SG AND I THINK ITS BTR THAN ALL COUNTRIES, and therefore shd be entitled to MORE than other countries in terms of influence, land, money etc"
[18/5/19, 14:41:17] Trina: The second one leads to selfishness-> imperialist ambitions-> war
[18/5/19, 14:42:18] Yi Hein: Hmmm lemme give u a situation, imagine SG's survivability is at risk, economy is tanking and the only way to survive is to Attack and conquer Malaysia
[18/5/19, 14:42:26] Yi Hein: would u support the cause?
[18/5/19, 14:43:58] Trina: If that's the only way then no choice rigjt
[18/5/19, 14:44:02] Trina: Self preservation man
[18/5/19, 14:44:38] Yi Hein: but you gotta kill ppl for your personal self-interest
[18/5/19, 14:44:55] Trina: Is not personal leh
[18/5/19, 14:45:14] Trina: Is not for me only but also for the many other ppl I care abt
[18/5/19, 14:45:41] Trina: Ofc I would be ok w ppl idk dying more than my own family n friends
[18/5/19, 14:47:23] Yi Hein: isn't wanting your family to stay alive also self-interest? Cos the enemy is also fighting to their family would stay alive
[18/5/19, 14:47:45] Trina: TRU then ok
[18/5/19, 14:47:52] Trina: Ya i rather they die than my family pls
[18/5/19, 14:48:22] Trina: Got ppl who will choose the other way round meh
[18/5/19, 14:48:59] Yi Hein: Me? LOLOLOLOL
[18/5/19, 14:49:06] Trina: WHY???????
[18/5/19, 14:49:50] Yi Hein: I'm quite utilitarian, so if me and my family dies, but the overall result is that less ppl die then isn't it quite a good deal
[18/5/19, 14:50:07] Trina: I cannot leh
[18/5/19, 14:50:24] Yi Hein: Like net positive effect
[18/5/19, 14:50:28] Trina: I'd shoot them in a heartbeat if my family can live
[18/5/19, 14:50:30] Trina: Is ok
[18/5/19, 14:52:19] Yi Hein: but they also love their family so for me it's hard to say: I should kill them because I think my love for my family is more important than theirs
[18/5/19, 14:53:30] Trina: War is selfish
[18/5/19, 14:53:33] Trina: 🙄🤙🏻
[18/5/19, 14:53:39] Yi Hein: Haha true
[18/5/19, 14:54:15] Yi Hein: Tbh I wanted to serve army hacksaw ridge style, become MO seems pretty good idea but oh well
[18/5/19, 14:54:39] Trina: Next year lor
[18/5/19, 14:56:25] Yi Hein: oh if I do get a command post after commissioning, I'll be in combat unit training to kill ppl
[18/5/19, 14:56:37] Yi Hein: MO is only if I disrupt NS
[18/5/19, 14:57:17] Trina: Is ok just hope no war LOLOLol

[18/5/19, 15:03:39] Yi Hein: We were doing fire fight in the jungle and I was acting as the enemy
[18/5/19, 15:04:25] Yi Hein: My instructor told me to kill as many of my section mates as possible (with blanks ofc)
[18/5/19, 15:04:32] Yi Hein: And I just blindly followed
[18/5/19, 15:05:23] Yi Hein: aimed and shot more than half of my section mates
[18/5/19, 15:05:48] Trina: But they nvr get harmed so it's ok what
[18/5/19, 15:06:18] Yi Hein: But it's the act of taking aim at your friends and pulling the trigger that's significant
[18/5/19, 15:06:32] Yi Hein: It's the intent
[18/5/19, 15:06:43] Trina: Ohhhh I see
[18/5/19, 15:07:00] Trina: Like it's dissociating?
[18/5/19, 15:07:14] Yi Hein: hmmm what do you mean by dissociating?

[18/5/19, 15:13:27] Trina: WTH can just walk down the streets
[18/5/19, 15:13:38] Trina: Nowhere to hide/ use terrain to our advantage
[18/5/19, 15:13:43] Trina: Plus we are all so closely packed
[18/5/19, 15:14:45] Yi Hein: SAF has quite a lot of training in urban operation so not that bad I guess

[18/5/19, 15:32:44] Yi Hein: It's so confusing what they're looking for actly a rather diverse set of people
[18/5/19, 15:33:15] Yi Hein: Yu Chun got in as a PR which is LEGENDARY

[18/5/19, 15:34:11] Trina: 280 accepted
[18/5/19, 15:34:17] Trina: I thought usually it's 300+?!
[18/5/19, 15:34:34] Yi Hein: Yeah that was what I thought
[18/5/19, 15:34:36] Yi Hein: Idk lol
[18/5/19, 15:34:52] Trina: Mayb they nvr count those ppl who alr got accepted but nvr defer

[18/5/19, 15:35:32] Yi Hein: which article is it?
[18/5/19, 15:35:52] Trina: Some "ITE BOY GET INTO NUS MED! WOW!" Article
‎[18/5/19, 15:36:01] Trina: ‎image omitted
[18/5/19, 15:36:13] Trina: SIGH I can only read till here
[18/5/19, 15:36:57] Yi Hein: What a legend
[18/5/19, 15:37:01] Yi Hein: That's actually amazing
[18/5/19, 15:37:16] Trina: Agree
[18/5/19, 15:37:27] Trina: But I don't like the narrative they r pushing lol
[18/5/19, 15:37:33] Yi Hein: yeah it's for show
[18/5/19, 15:37:38] Yi Hein: And it's only one guy
[18/5/19, 15:37:50] Trina: That NUS med is the pinnacle of excellence/ the best definition of success
[18/5/19, 15:38:04] Trina: Like WTH? So the other ITE ppl who get into NUS= not gd??0
[18/5/19, 15:38:41] Trina: Would have been better to choose ITE ppl who got into Sg unis (variety of courses) and interview pls
[18/5/19, 15:39:28] Yi Hein: I feel like this is more to demonstrate educational mobility (if that terms exists), to use NUS med makes the story compelling
[18/5/19, 15:39:41] Trina: But I think this is not the best way
[18/5/19, 15:40:10] Trina: It makes NUS med seem like the only and best way to succeed which is bad bc now u have people wanting to do med for prestige/"success"
[18/5/19, 15:40:34] Yi Hein: Yeah I agree
[18/5/19, 15:40:42] Trina: On the other hand it simultaneously discredits the other ITE ppl who get into local unis.. for all u know they chose other courses for interest what
[18/5/19, 15:41:05] Yi Hein: well after all they are reporters, and they'll say it in a matter to capture attention and viewership
[18/5/19, 15:41:31] Trina: Ya but aiya knowing that this will capture attention I think it's not v responsible of them
[18/5/19, 15:41:54] Yi Hein: Still mild compared to CNN and FOX news
[18/5/19, 15:42:07] Trina: LOLOL

[8/6/19, 22:45:13] Yi Hein: I’m in interested how this idea came about?
[8/6/19, 22:51:10] Trina: YESSS OkokoOoo
[8/6/19, 22:51:20] Trina: My sis and I thought of it randomly la
[8/6/19, 22:51:37] Trina: After volunteering w NKF n hearing the ppl share their life stories lolol
[8/6/19, 22:51:52] Yi Hein: Haha nice
[8/6/19, 22:51:59] Trina: SO ok u do the podcast thing?
[8/6/19, 22:52:28] Yi Hein: noooooo pls
[8/6/19, 22:52:39] Yi Hein: I’m not the best speaker ard
[8/6/19, 22:52:46] Trina: U no need speak!!!!!
[8/6/19, 22:52:57] Trina: Just interview the old ppl and help them write their story
[8/6/19, 22:53:06] Trina: Someone else will read it if you DW
[8/6/19, 22:53:47] Trina: I think to make things simpler podcast we separate into 2 types: ppl who we want to directly interview in Q&A format, and those who we share their stories on behalf of
[8/6/19, 22:54:11] Trina: You can do the second one so 1. Interview them for a gd story 2. Translate 3. Write into story form (I CAN HELP W THIS)
[8/6/19, 22:54:17] Trina: 4. Get someone to read
[8/6/19, 22:54:42] Trina: For 4 I was thinking can open opportunities for students who wanna speak on air haha quite fun for them also. Symbiosis man
[8/6/19, 22:57:14] Yi Hein: errr I don’t think I’m suited tbh
[8/6/19, 22:57:38] Yi Hein: might as well choose someone who is strong in both speaking and writing then you only need 1 person instead of outsourcing it to multiple people
[8/6/19, 22:57:56] Trina: what u wanna do
[8/6/19, 22:58:05] Trina: we can.. um.. CREATE roles
[8/6/19, 22:58:50] Trina: This kinda person is RARE pls so I'm ok w splitting

[8/6/19, 23:00:19] Trina: OK because u won't be the only one at the interview
[8/6/19, 23:00:39] Trina: Whichever form of podcast format u choose someone WILL be there w u
[8/6/19, 23:00:53] Trina: You can just set the direction/qns and get the HOST to ask

[16/3/20, 15:39:15] Yi Hein: I called them to tell them how retarded it is
[16/3/20, 15:39:21] Trina: wat they say

[16/3/20, 15:39:29] Trina: yo u got the scholarship boy
[16/3/20, 15:39:35] Yi Hein: How does that negate my argument
[16/3/20, 15:39:58] Trina: what’s a thumb drive in the context of a bond free scholarship is what they r sayin
[16/3/20, 15:40:01] Trina: win some lose some
[16/3/20, 15:40:08] Trina: lose $5 maybe get $300k
[16/3/20, 15:40:12] Trina: it’s 4d
[16/3/20, 15:41:03] Yi Hein: The point is not abt the cost of the thumb drive, it’s about intentionally doing things in an inefficient troublesome manner when there’s a clearly a better solution
[16/3/20, 15:41:15] Trina: did u tell them that
[16/3/20, 15:41:18] Trina: they gna kill u
[16/3/20, 15:41:22] Trina: hahahahahaha
[16/3/20, 15:41:37] Yi Hein: as in the people collecting the applications are just ppl outsourced

[16/3/20, 15:42:54] Yi Hein: I’m just imagining some poor dude has to stick in 1000 thumb drives one by one
[16/3/20, 15:42:56] Trina: were u bein rude

[16/3/20, 16:02:04] Trina: why leh
[16/3/20, 16:02:53] Yi Hein: if I get NUS there’s no way my parent will allow me to go overseas (unless I get LCK)
[16/3/20, 16:02:59] Trina: :(
[16/3/20, 16:03:07] Trina: ethical dilemma
[16/3/20, 16:03:09] Trina: srs
[16/3/20, 16:03:33] Yi Hein: I don’t think I can bring myself to do it though, feels like I’m betraying my parents
[16/3/20, 16:03:43] Trina: why u wna go uk so badly
[16/3/20, 16:03:52] Trina: is it vvvvvVv impt to u
[16/3/20, 16:04:20] Yi Hein: I just don’t think singapore is the right place to position me to pursue my aspirations in the future
[16/3/20, 16:04:32] Yi Hein: Ppl here still too fixed and close minded
[16/3/20, 16:04:36] Trina: is is rly tho
[16/3/20, 16:04:46] Yi Hein: My impression at least
[16/3/20, 16:04:52] Trina: think it is still very possible just need to find the right people
[16/3/20, 16:05:03] Trina: got many things working against u in the uk as well
[16/3/20, 16:05:15] Trina: not exactly gna be a much much btr place leh
[16/3/20, 16:05:27] Trina: first off they r alr kinda racist let’s start w that
[16/3/20, 16:05:31] Yi Hein: in what sense though
[16/3/20, 16:05:42] Trina: also idk how they gna give out opportunities if u aren’t local
[16/3/20, 16:05:54] Trina: logically they would prioritise their own citizens lah
[16/3/20, 16:06:15] Trina: and also got other issues like adjusting to a new env, having to build new networks
[16/3/20, 16:06:34] Trina: and if u are eventually coming back to sg u lose a few years of making connections in med/tech
[16/3/20, 16:06:39] Trina: just my opinion
[16/3/20, 16:07:09] Yi Hein: In terms of school opportunities?
[16/3/20, 16:07:20] Trina: ya or even internships i guess
[16/3/20, 16:07:44] Trina: why would they give opportunities to ppl who Won’t stay and work
[16/3/20, 16:08:30] Trina: from what I know there are a fair share of ppl in med who are quite on abt medtech.. and it seems like that’s the direction for quite a lot of things when they are taking abt how to progress
[16/3/20, 16:09:11] Trina: but ya la i think sg doesn’t rly give much breathing room to do extra stuff esp in m3-5 and .. while serving ur bond
[16/3/20, 16:10:07] Yi Hein: Oh I wasn’t aware of this
[16/3/20, 16:10:23] Yi Hein: more details?
[16/3/20, 16:10:25] Trina: like ok wait ah i find the example ok

[16/3/20, 16:15:51] Yi Hein: Yeah that’s great that they’re pushing for it
[16/3/20, 16:15:58] Yi Hein: What about student sentiment though?
‎[16/3/20, 16:16:15] Trina: ‎image omitted
[16/3/20, 16:16:25] Trina: some interest groups for innovation and stuff
[16/3/20, 16:16:29] Trina: generally very meh
[16/3/20, 16:16:40] Trina: in all honesty most ppl just wna be doctors
[16/3/20, 16:16:53] Trina: even stuff like health policy, preventive health the interest is low
[16/3/20, 16:16:59] Yi Hein: Mhmmm but it’s a good start
[16/3/20, 16:17:02] Trina: most ppl wna do IM and surgery la
[16/3/20, 16:17:04] Trina: normal stuff
[16/3/20, 16:17:07] Trina: as expected
[16/3/20, 16:17:17] Yi Hein: What do you mean
[16/3/20, 16:17:44] Trina: non traditional specialties
[16/3/20, 16:17:47] Trina: not pppular at all
[16/3/20, 16:17:53] Trina: legit
[16/3/20, 16:18:04] Trina: not to mention even non med stuff like tech
[16/3/20, 16:18:08] Yi Hein: preventive health is a specificalty?
[16/3/20, 16:18:08] Trina: don’t even need to say
[16/3/20, 16:18:16] Trina: ya LOLOL I also didn’t know

[16/3/20, 16:19:12] Yi Hein: The government Super enthusiastic about innovation
[16/3/20, 16:19:33] Yi Hein: Transforming Singapore into an innovation and entrepreneurship hub
[16/3/20, 16:19:42] Yi Hein: But I don’t think the ppl are prepared
[16/3/20, 16:19:52] Yi Hein: LOL
[16/3/20, 16:21:08] Trina: it will take a while
[16/3/20, 16:21:29] Trina: but if u are damn prepared u have little competition to succeed ain’t it
[16/3/20, 16:23:07] Yi Hein: Hahaha exactly what I’m thinking
[16/3/20, 16:25:24] Trina: is true what
[16/3/20, 16:25:45] Trina: and it’s hard to break into uk market without a clear understanding of their needs
[16/3/20, 16:26:00] Trina: hard to understand that as a foreign student
[16/3/20, 16:26:15] Trina: hard for ppl to listen to u as a foreign student
[16/3/20, 16:27:05] Yi Hein: yeah you’ve a point
[16/3/20, 16:27:26] Trina: can be done anywhere la
[16/3/20, 16:27:31] Trina: jiayou
[16/3/20, 16:27:47] Trina: personally I always think it’s btr to have options
[16/3/20, 16:28:17] Yi Hein: True
‎[16/3/20, 16:28:25] Trina: ‎sticker omitted
[16/3/20, 16:28:56] Yi Hein: You do seem to have quite a bit of clarity on this
[16/3/20, 16:32:32] Trina: ikr
[16/3/20, 16:32:53] Trina: if need to talk just lemme kno ok
[16/3/20, 16:32:56] Trina: no worries
[16/3/20, 16:35:22] Yi Hein: Yup thanks
[16/3/20, 18:25:30] Yi Hein: Also I was thinking of a business idea this morning
[16/3/20, 18:38:17] Yi Hein: *SickPod*

A capsule hotel for the sick. But only individualised isolated.

Falling sick? Don’t go home! Don’t go back to work! Stop the spread and keep your loved ones safe. SickPod provides a contained area for the sick to stay when they are ill.

Key Features:
- Enables you to work from the SickPod, work computer, web camera and streaming 
- Food and meals provided via a slot into the SickPod - minimal interaction with outside world
- access to telemedicine doctor consultations
- prescription delivery
- advanced monitoring systems to track disease progression and recovery 

Stop the spread of flu.
Avoid negative externalities of going to work sick.
Engage with companies - who may be a big push factor in getting employees into SickPods -> but companies can just tell them to not go to work and stay at home rather than paying SickPod money-> pull factor: work ready facilities -> webcam, streaming

Reminders to take medication and sleep, continuous health monitoring 

- think of it as a high powered and efficient recovery Bay
[16/3/20, 18:38:21] Yi Hein: What do you think
[16/3/20, 18:57:49] Trina: wats the diff between this and an isolation ward
[16/3/20, 18:57:56] Trina: price or
[16/3/20, 18:58:16] Yi Hein: Yes
[16/3/20, 18:58:27] Yi Hein: And many other stuff
[16/3/20, 18:58:41] Yi Hein: Principal Consideration: Must be convenient and accessible enough to be worth it. Build it in house within an organisatiosn -> enables use of the organisation’s intranet -> solves the real estate problem
[16/3/20, 18:58:50] Yi Hein: Like being able to work
[16/3/20, 18:59:30] Yi Hein: There wouldn’t be any medical staff tagged to this, more of a type of accommodation than a healthcare organisation
[16/3/20, 18:59:29] Trina: sry stupid qn
[16/3/20, 18:59:31] Trina: how to pee
[16/3/20, 18:59:33] Trina: and bathe
[16/3/20, 19:00:04] Yi Hein: Maybe built in toilet? But would add significantly to the space and cost
[16/3/20, 19:00:24] Trina: if it’s not built in then is the same ain’t it
[16/3/20, 19:00:27] Trina: still needa go out
[16/3/20, 19:00:31] Yi Hein: Yeah
[16/3/20, 19:00:42] Yi Hein: Maybe there’s another solution
[16/3/20, 19:01:29] Trina: i see where u r coming from tho
[16/3/20, 19:01:37] Trina: depending on how the thing spreads
[16/3/20, 19:02:00] Trina: if it’s like covid through sneezin and stuff then mask enough right
[16/3/20, 19:02:18] Trina: is the mentality like isolate the body part that’s shooting out the germs lolol
[16/3/20, 19:03:22] Yi Hein: Yeah but this never works
[16/3/20, 19:03:45] Trina: why ah
[16/3/20, 19:03:54] Trina: is a good thing to ask
[16/3/20, 19:03:56] Trina: is it compliance
[16/3/20, 19:04:29] Trina: if yes, then why are ppl not wearing it.. like mayb. make it more comfortable
[16/3/20, 19:04:36] Yi Hein: Hmm yeah people never wear it properly
[16/3/20, 19:04:56] Trina: maybe make one that is foolproof
[16/3/20, 19:05:04] Yi Hein: But you do have a point
‎[16/3/20, 19:05:16] Trina: ‎sticker omitted
[16/3/20, 19:06:09] Yi Hein: Also when you’re eating etc
[16/3/20, 19:06:32] Trina: YA
[16/3/20, 19:06:51] Yi Hein: What about spread through contact though
[16/3/20, 19:07:01] Trina: how does that work
[16/3/20, 19:07:09] Trina: germ just jump!?
[16/3/20, 19:07:23] Yi Hein: Idk you’re the medical student hahaha
[16/3/20, 19:07:31] Trina: hello u too

[16/3/20, 19:09:14] Trina: dk problem then dk solution also
[16/3/20, 19:10:13] Yi Hein: But basically some retard in my office decided to book in with stomach flu, interacted with him only like 5 mins...and BOOM I got it too. So I got sick and went back home..and BOOM now my entire family got it
[16/3/20, 19:10:20] Yi Hein: It spreads through contact apparently

[14/10/20, 10:20:17] Trina: like make it more academic? the story can be a way to lead the reader in
[14/10/20, 10:20:31] Trina: but maybe cannot be the whole thing
[14/10/20, 10:20:42] Trina: u got any more awards not
[14/10/20, 10:20:48] Trina: i try to see if can link
[14/10/20, 10:21:28] Yi Hein: nothing related to law...
[14/10/20, 10:21:42] Trina: das hard
[14/10/20, 10:21:50] Yi Hein: science competitions, research competitions, bio deans list
[14/10/20, 10:22:27] Yi Hein: Like shorten it to first half? Then second half on acads?
[14/10/20, 10:22:52] Trina: idk leh i feel like can still mention?...? cos u alr showed u have the reason for wantng law
[14/10/20, 10:23:05] Trina: so now i wna know (as a reader) how u are qualified to want law
[14/10/20, 10:23:08] Trina: u kno
[14/10/20, 10:23:11] Trina: idk leh i feel like can still mention?...?
[14/10/20, 10:23:17] Yi Hein: Ohhh I see
[14/10/20, 10:23:44] Yi Hein: Ok can I’ll see what I can do
[14/10/20, 10:23:49] Trina: i think can try?
[14/10/20, 10:24:00] Trina: can remove narrative details of the story
[14/10/20, 10:26:24] Trina: i got idea! cos u talked abt how u had to prepare to defend ur friend right
[14/10/20, 10:26:35] Trina: LSE: "Have you developed your subject interest outside of your school studies? For example, have you undertaken any additional reading to broaden your knowledge of the subject? Have you attended lectures or explored online material relating to the subject? What did you find interesting in your reading/in the lectures you attended and what are your thoughts on the topics covered?"
[14/10/20, 10:27:03] Trina: so u can talk abt what u looked into and why u thought it was interesting? eg any specific books etcetc
[14/10/20, 10:28:10] Trina: i think the acads part is q impt cos the oxford peeps dont ask much abt the story during the interview.. even tho it is v interesting to talk abt, odds are the case given for discussion has been set alr so its not gna be abt civil/military law. they probs will ask it as an icebreaker type qn only
[14/10/20, 10:34:36] Yi Hein: Oh right it’s like on the spot analysis of the case
[14/10/20, 10:36:54] Trina: mhmmmmmmmmo
[14/10/20, 10:38:54] Yi Hein: Maybe I can use Council for campaigning and persuading haha
[14/10/20, 10:39:08] Trina: is can
[14/10/20, 10:39:19] Trina: try to think of more acads one and link tho
[14/10/20, 10:39:34] Yi Hein: Acads meaning like concrete awards?
[14/10/20, 10:39:35] Trina: UK uni no need care much abt cca
[14/10/20, 10:39:38] Trina: ya
[14/10/20, 10:39:55] Yi Hein: 6 for Lang lit 😢
[14/10/20, 10:39:57] Trina: CCA is gd when u can link it (like in this case) but otherwise i think they favour acads
[14/10/20, 10:40:01] Trina: LOLLLL same
[14/10/20, 10:40:04] Trina: is ok one
[14/10/20, 10:40:11] Trina: 😳✌🏻
[14/10/20, 10:40:33] Trina: just needa find a way to link it back to analysis and logical thinking
[14/10/20, 10:41:59] Yi Hein: Doesn’t showing communication skills, logical thinking -> qualified?
[14/10/20, 10:42:12] Trina: yup it does
[14/10/20, 10:42:18] Trina: but just UK tingz

[14/10/20, 10:43:20] Trina: i loled
[14/10/20, 10:43:47] Trina: -> analytical, methodological, detail orientated
[14/10/20, 10:45:31] Yi Hein: I’ll just put what I think is relevant, no point keep scrapping the barrel when there’s nothing hahaha
[14/10/20, 10:45:34] Yi Hein: but yeah I’ll focus a lot more on qualification for laq

[18/10/17, 07:59:53] Yi Hein: i can't seem to access the make fair planning documents, can someone share it with me? chaiyihein@gmail.com
[18/10/17, 07:59:58] Yi Hein: thanks
[18/10/17, 08:09:20] Gideon Tay: Shared
[18/10/17, 08:11:25] Yi Hein: received, thank you!

[28/10/17, 14:32:03] AJ Loy: Hi guys, if you check the drive, inside the "letters" folder, I've drafted a template for the invitational letters to speakers. Some specific formalities have yet to be decided as you'll see but the content is pretty much there. Would be good if y'all could take a quick look and make edits/comments! Thanks guys :)

Also, as mentioned at the last meeting, we'll be having student contacts specifically for each speaker to help them develop content and attend to their questions/requests. We'll need 4, so if you guys read the description at the bottom of the same doc and feel like you wanna be the student contact, do go ahead and put your name down (and send a message to this group)! If we're short on student contacts, I'll be one of them. Thanks :)
[28/10/17, 17:10:08] Yang Qing: 👌 👌
[28/10/17, 17:45:08] Gideon Tay: Hmm, I think it'll be nice for the student contacts to have known the speaker beforehand?
[28/10/17, 17:45:54] Gideon Tay: So AJ I think you should be the student contact for the drummer speaker cos u know him and he'll prob be more comfortable... 
and maybe I can be the student contact for Debra?
Just wondering if this is better.
[28/10/17, 17:46:21] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: wasn't that the initial arrangement
[28/10/17, 17:47:00] Gideon Tay: Hmm, but AJ's message said to just put in your name in the student contact
[28/10/17, 17:47:08] Gideon Tay: For all speakers
[28/10/17, 17:48:23] Gideon Tay: But for the other 2 speakers I don't think anyone knows them
[28/10/17, 17:48:43] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: oh I thought he was referring to the other 2 only
[28/10/17, 17:48:46] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: but okay sure yea
[28/10/17, 17:48:56] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: I agree with this
[28/10/17, 17:54:48] Gideon Tay: Oh, ok then
[28/10/17, 20:49:33] AJ Loy: Haha yup sorry Gideon you’re right, slipped my mind earlier!

[27/11/17, 22:38:33] Yi Hein: Btw has Ms Chua gotten back to us yet?
[28/11/17, 09:59:24] AJ Loy: Yup :))
[28/11/17, 10:00:07] AJ Loy: Yes and no, I’ve been bugging her both in person and on whatsapp but I’m giving her the benefit of doubt, she must be _very_ busy
[28/11/17, 10:00:54] AJ Loy: Btw I created a Budget spreadsheet in the folder so could y’all (esp unique features and shirts) pls fill that up? Thanks
[30/11/17, 21:01:35] AJ Loy: K guys, end Nov is here, Ding Ding!
[30/11/17, 21:03:23] AJ Loy: All letters to speakers have been approved and formatted nicely in the folder. Emails have been sent @6592971440 @6598778369 and @6597340920 , you and I will have to hand deliver our letters (I’ll pm you).

I hope everyone else is on schedule too (or if not, will be soon). More importantly, does anyone have anything urgent to raise or any concerns/major queries as of now?

[29/12/17, 14:27:13] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: hello, do y’all think the programme flow is ok as it was? what edits do y’all think we shld make
[29/12/17, 14:33:10] AJ Loy: Yeah I think it looks good. Except the 10 mins intermission in the SAC might not work so well. Perhaps don’t call it a break but just “moving time” then they can go to the toilet or get water on the way or smth? By the time everyone is dismissed and settles down again, the 10 mins is likely to be up?
[29/12/17, 14:35:55] AJ Loy: @6590109860 please communicate the important info in the letters to the SUTD people if you haven’t already done so, thanks!
[29/12/17, 14:53:03] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: sure
[29/12/17, 14:53:14] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: i’ll make edits accordingly
[29/12/17, 15:08:04] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: hm sorry i realised that if we are maintaining the 4:33 keynote and 4:33 QnA, we won’t have enough time as it stands.
[29/12/17, 15:08:37] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: shld we just take out QnA in the keynote? since they can have their qns answered in the breakout anws

[29/12/17, 15:31:05] AJ Loy: Mm ok!
[29/12/17, 15:31:53] AJ Loy: Yeah hopefully with the rehearsals we’ll work it out so there’s always something happening on stage, also to sustain attention

[12/2/18, 19:13:22] AJ Loy: Work out how many people you need to be ushers, what you need them to do. Which venues we will use, how the speaker’s will find their way around and the classes
[12/2/18, 19:13:39] AJ Loy: Cos time is kinda tight it needs to run like clockwork/UG 😂
[12/2/18, 19:13:56] AJ Loy: Yeah, coming from ASP
[12/2/18, 20:03:29] Gideon Tay: Oh ok thanks :)

[15/2/18, 18:32:00] AJ Loy: Yes please begin contacting them!
[15/2/18, 18:32:20] AJ Loy: Yeah, you can cc TC if you want too but ms Lianne Chua definitely
[15/2/18, 18:32:45] AJ Loy: Thanks guys 👍🏻
[21/2/18, 13:49:04] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: Hey guys, I made an "Archives" folder for us to put our outdated proposals or whatever unnecessary documents bc the present folder looks kinda messy. Also, I renamed it "MAKE18" fyi
[21/2/18, 13:55:33] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: Sorry can i check, will we be releasing any promotional footage leading up to MAKE18?
[21/2/18, 14:20:53] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: Sorry can we also check with Mr Chiew as to the exact timings (since he's also checking the exact date)?
[21/2/18, 14:21:21] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: So it'll be easier to put out the AP and co-ordinate the minute-by-minute flow with Sian

[22/2/18, 13:06:19] AJ Loy: Great thanks Lucas!
[22/2/18, 13:07:03] AJ Loy: Probably not because we don’t need to advertise since it’s compulsory. However, given time and resources, we may, if only to increase the hype
[22/2/18, 13:08:14] AJ Loy: Not sure yet, but ideally end of the day
[22/2/18, 13:09:43] AJ Loy: This is mr Chiew’s intention too but he’s currently checking with the MT dept as express may be having intensive revision
[22/2/18, 13:10:15] AJ Loy: Do you need exact times for this or just time elapsed relative to the start of the event?
[22/2/18, 13:51:28] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: okay sure
[22/2/18, 13:52:00] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: the time elapsed is alr set to be 1.5 hrs right? i’d prefer to have exact times
[22/2/18, 14:25:58] AJ Loy: Ah ok, as soon as they’re out I’m sure Sir will let us know

[26/2/18, 06:33:39] Gideon Tay: She’s asking. Thx. And time too
[26/2/18, 09:10:07] AJ Loy: @6592419055 @6581395211 Thanks for your promptness Gideon!

How about Isaiah and Jiawei send a list of questions that would be good to have in the video (more is better than less!) here so that the other speaker contacts can use it. Then ask her to send you a Skype video message or you can arrange with her yourself? Otherwise we involve a lot of logs and connections - just a suggestion :)
[26/2/18, 14:06:52] Gideon Tay: Pls update asap thx
[26/2/18, 14:07:14] Gideon Tay: She says she can meet in person
[26/2/18, 19:51:31] Isaiah Koh: What brought you to your current line of work?
[26/2/18, 19:51:31] Isaiah Koh: What was the most life-changing moment you had?
[26/2/18, 19:51:53] Isaiah Koh: Questiona for speakers for Gideon
[26/2/18, 19:52:35] Isaiah Koh: If you were given a chance to go back in time and relive a year of your life, which year would it be?
[26/2/18, 19:55:15] AJ Loy: Fantastic thanks Isaiah, @6597340920 @6590109860 can use these too for your speakers to base their “interview” responses off

[2/3/18, 09:49:48] Jia Wei Chen: Okay thanks

[2/3/18, 19:20:11] Luke Ow: hi guys! Does anyone know a contact that makes corporate gifts? Like postits, etc.
[2/3/18, 20:39:50] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: i’ve asked daniel peh to sort of illicit faster responses from y5 asp
[2/3/18, 20:40:08] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: and highlighted in yellow those interested in next year’s comm
[2/3/18, 20:41:10] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: as far as i’m concerned, it would be good if i (and bev if she wants to) can be in the group with the volunteers so we can brief or inform accordingly
[2/3/18, 21:10:34] AJ Loy: 👍🏻thanks Lucas! When we’ve got the volunteers narrowed down, you, Bev (programme flow) and Isaiah and Chris (volunteer ICs) will be in the group to facilitate communication
[2/3/18, 21:11:04] AJ Loy: @6592419055 conservative estimate for shirt price is $12?
[2/3/18, 21:13:17] Isaiah Koh: _conservativ_
[2/3/18, 21:13:47] Isaiah Koh: i think it may cost more, especially if the design has more colours, such as our colour gradient
[2/3/18, 21:14:59] AJ Loy: Hmm unless you just do like the silhouette of it? Idk just an idea
[2/3/18, 21:15:34] Isaiah Koh: i could go back to the first logo draft with only yellow
[2/3/18, 21:16:06] Isaiah Koh: confirmed: dry-fit, two colour print is 14 per shirt
[2/3/18, 21:16:14] ‪+65 8590 5944‬: Nice or Price
[2/3/18, 21:17:35] AJ Loy: Haha up to you, idk aesthetics, but we try to keep costs down as much as possible. Mdm Yong suggested passing the design to Indonesian scholars going home over the hol to get it printed there (?) sounded sketchy but really cheap lol
[2/3/18, 21:18:11] Luke Ow: HAHAHAAH
[2/3/18, 21:18:11] ‪+65 8590 5944‬: can they print in 1 week though? cos March hols is very short
[2/3/18, 21:18:13] Luke Ow: smart
[2/3/18, 21:18:31] Luke Ow: also dont wan burden other ppl leh
[2/3/18, 21:18:34] Luke Ow: a bit paiseh
[2/3/18, 21:18:41] Isaiah Koh: agreed
[2/3/18, 21:18:49] AJ Loy: Mm true as well
[2/3/18, 21:18:59] Isaiah Koh: i mean, if its madam yong that does the asking then its less paiseh
[2/3/18, 21:19:28] ‪+65 8590 5944‬: I mean if we say mdm yong suggested then its less paiseh too
[2/3/18, 21:19:52] ‪+65 8590 5944‬: hahaha or can just thick skin
[3/3/18, 22:30:36] AJ Loy: Just checking in, @6597340920 @6590109860 have the speakers got back to you yet?
[4/3/18, 00:16:44] Yi Hein: Shucks haven't gotten round to calling them
[4/3/18, 00:17:01] Yi Hein: Will do on Monday, don't wanna disturb them on a weekend
[4/3/18, 09:11:54] AJ Loy: Ok just a gentle reminder! Thanks! Pramath too :)
[4/3/18, 09:15:14] Pramath Krishna: Yeah they haven't got back to me yet. I'll drop him another email reminding him on Monday.
[4/3/18, 09:18:23] AJ Loy: Thanks, if not, pls call him. Thanks!
[4/3/18, 09:25:01] Pramath Krishna: Yup will do
[5/3/18, 09:33:59] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: hey all, i’ve created a grp with the Y5 ASP volunteers, aj, gideon, chris, isaiah and bev
[5/3/18, 09:34:13] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: if anyone else would like to be added, do sound out
[7/3/18, 00:32:24] AJ Loy: Heads up everyone, there will be a meeting in T2W1 by which:
-Shirt quotes will be in @6592419055
-Unqiue Features will have completed their budget and sourcing @6586168005 @6596129742 @6591120067 @6585905944
-MR helpers will have been confirmed @6581395211
- Speaker liaison will have been completed @6592971440 @6597340920 @6590109860 @6598778369

Please refer to my update sent to the group with Sir for more details.

During the meeting, the items above will present to the comm (briefly) so that we are all on the same page. Then Lucas and Bev will give us a rundown of the admin programme for the day which is important for everyone. After that we’ll move into discussion of the rehearsal details from @6591120067 and the next steps we will each take.

As this is a big meeting with a lot to cover, I would appreciate it if EVERYONE was able to come together. How is Whitespace on Friday for everyone? (SL2 also works but I also want the Y5 volunteers to attend so we’ll see how Whitespace is first)
[8/3/18, 00:10:28] AJ Loy: The question in the above message was: “How is Whitespace on Friday for everyone?”

((I swear I’m not being paggro but yeah actual responses would be greatly appreciated!))

Please make yourselves available, if you know you are needed. If you need excuse from CCA or other things pls let me know so I can ask Mr Chiew to write in for you.

[1/5/18, 22:53:18] AJ Loy: Updated versions, not many affected :)
[2/5/18, 06:09:08] Yi Hein: Hey guys, I can't make it for the rehearsal today, down with sickness.
[2/5/18, 06:42:43] AJ Loy: Thanks for letting us know, take care Yi Hein!
[2/5/18, 15:37:07] Sian Lexmond: Hello speaker contacts, y’all did ask your speakers to bring an item symbolizing their “innovation” right?
[2/5/18, 15:39:28] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: aj i presume you will be giving the cue when y’all are about to enter
[2/5/18, 15:42:12] Beverly: Side note, MR will control the volume right? Meaning i’ll just fix the volume on the com and they will adjust if it’s too loud/soft
[2/5/18, 15:42:16] AJ Loy: Cue!
[2/5/18, 15:44:22] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: update on this?
[2/5/18, 15:45:00] AJ Loy: None yet. I just asked Mr Chiew. Work without them for now
[2/5/18, 15:55:05] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: need to settle the 4:33 thing
[2/5/18, 15:57:11] Gideon Tay: Note for MR: ensure that there are always 2 mics backstage
[2/5/18, 15:58:17] Beverly: That are turned on
[2/5/18, 15:59:29] ‪+65 8333 2125‬: order of sitting on stage for panel discussion
[2/5/18, 15:59:50] Jia Wei Chen: Yup ok
[2/5/18, 15:59:56] Jia Wei Chen: Indeed we do
[2/5/18, 16:00:41] Sian Lexmond: Also, we need to get our own AA batteries for the wireless mics, MR doesn’t provide
[2/5/18, 16:05:27] Yi Hein: For Puzzles, they would need ppl to help out with their breakout session. We can either,
1. Get our own volunteers to help out (would need 2hr training session beforehand)
Or
2. They can hire helpers to facilitate
[2/5/18, 16:08:09] Sian Lexmond: @6597260986 @6584339855 

The apron stage can be lowered and the speakers can go speak on the apron stage as the spotlight can follow them, we aren’t confined by the stage lights anymore!!
[2/5/18, 16:08:26] Sian Lexmond: Can someone help me tell Sir!
[2/5/18, 16:09:15] Luke Ow: Meaning?
[2/5/18, 16:09:22] Luke Ow: What is the implication
[2/5/18, 16:10:03] Sian Lexmond: Because Sir is worried about them “reaching down” for the items if the apron stage is lowered but if they can speak on the apron stage, that problem is eliminated and the panel discussion will still not be blocked
[2/5/18, 16:10:33] Luke Ow: Ok can prob solved sir say ok
[2/5/18, 18:50:20] AJ Loy: Let’s try 1. Puzzles is going to have their breakout in CPA2, there’ll be several comm members and volunteers there (can check which 2 are free and willing) When can they have the training? One of the days after school next week?
[2/5/18, 18:50:47] AJ Loy: Noted, thanks! How many do they need?
[2/5/18, 18:52:20] AJ Loy: Yeap, I actually have an external monitor I can bring to put behind one of the boxes. Then can hide the com inside the box? Are there sockets on the stage near where we’re putting the boxes?
[2/5/18, 18:54:47] AJ Loy: Mm thanks for the reminder, I’ll compile a list of all the finer points speakers need to be aware of and send it out so speaker contacts can forward straight to the speakers
[2/5/18, 19:08:27] AJ Loy: Thank you everyone for your awesomeness today, was kinda stressed out >< but everyone really came through so that we met most of our objectives 😊 so grateful for y’all!

I’ll send out my last update later on with the all-important ToDo list! :)
[7/5/18, 15:59:19] AJ Loy: @6583332125 Mdm Yong will give the opening address

[15/5/18, 08:46:08] AJ Loy: The only thing we need to change is the finishing time for preparations in CPA2 (MAKE boxes) by 1220 and prepare for them to enter
[15/5/18, 08:52:50] Sian Lexmond: Somethings to note for the *speaker contacts*
1. Please remind your speaker to bring their item and pass it to one of the stage hands so we can preset it on the boxes before their speeches 
2. Please ask your speaker to deliver their speech from the apron stage, it should be lowered by tomorrow

Thank you!
[15/5/18, 22:17:58] AJ Loy: Hi everyone, I’m gonna move the briefing time forwards to *1120* in view of the earlier starting time. So I’ll see everyone tomorrow in event tee at the CPA2 stage!

Check with sir?

[17/7/18, 18:29:18] AJ Loy: No MAKE18 shouldn’t be reflected as a CCA, just an event which should be captured under your SGC
[17/7/18, 18:29:39] AJ Loy: ? SRC should be there, especially if you’ve participated in comps recently

  [16/2/17, 20:02:06] Yi Hein: I'm Yi Hein
  [16/2/17, 20:03:22] Yi Hein: My name is spelt wrongly in the class photo list, it should be "Yi Hein" instead of "Hien"
  [16/2/17, 20:03:36] Yi Hein: Can you help me change it?

  [16/2/17, 20:30:09] Shannon: My apologies!!!

  [16/2/17, 20:40:44] Yi Hein: Yup thank you!
  [16/2/17, 20:58:38] Shannon: Haha np!! Sorry for the mistake :P
  [16/2/17, 21:10:22] Shannon: Oh right btw do you take econs?
  [16/2/17, 23:54:56] Yi Hein: Yeah
  [18/2/17, 20:05:47] Shannon: Sorry to bother you but!!! For the econs hw, are you just writing out your points for the question?
  [18/2/17, 20:06:09] Shannon: Idk what we're supposed to do
  [18/2/17, 20:06:13] Shannon: :(
  [18/2/17, 21:20:19] Yi Hein: Sorry for late reply😅
  [18/2/17, 21:20:30] Yi Hein: But I actually I'm not quite sure too
  [18/2/17, 21:21:17] Yi Hein: I've only written my introductory paragraph, which is just paraphrasing key concepts in the slides
  [18/2/17, 21:23:39] Yi Hein: I'm kind of waiting for the teacher to teach econs essay writing before I complete it; so there's no need to redo
  [18/2/17, 21:52:18] Shannon: HAHA I'm so confused now, we have to talk about scarcity too?
  [18/2/17, 21:52:42] Yi Hein: I guess it's all inter-related
  [18/2/17, 21:53:00] Yi Hein: Because choices and sacrifices have to be made due to limited resources
  [18/2/17, 21:54:56] Shannon: That's true
  [18/2/17, 21:54:57] Shannon: Thanks!!
  [18/2/17, 21:55:10] Shannon: Haha I think I'll just come up with points and not do the essay yet too :P
  [18/2/17, 21:55:27] Yi Hein: Yeah me too
  [18/2/17, 21:55:38] Yi Hein: Btw, have you done your Lang lit assignment?
  [18/2/17, 21:56:07] Shannon: Haha currently 2/3 done!!
  [18/2/17, 21:56:14] Shannon: I feel like I haven't written an essay in really Long
  [18/2/17, 21:56:20] Shannon: Have you done it?
  [18/2/17, 21:56:24] Yi Hein: Yeah me too
  [18/2/17, 21:56:33] Yi Hein: I've done like one page
  [18/2/17, 21:57:08] Yi Hein: But I'm struggling to complete one page even with all the "bullshit" and smoke 💨
  [18/2/17, 22:06:21] Shannon: HAHAHA ikr!! And I'm taking so Long to do it :P
  [18/2/17, 22:06:32] Shannon: I'm not even sure how much we are supposed to write
  [18/2/17, 22:06:54] Shannon: I don't think my sentences make much sense it's all like weird BS 😂
  [18/2/17, 22:07:01] Yi Hein: Hahaha
  [18/2/17, 22:07:12] Yi Hein: Btw have gotten to know you yet
  [18/2/17, 22:07:20] Yi Hein: What school were you from?
  [18/2/17, 22:15:48] Shannon: MGS!!
  [18/2/17, 22:15:55] Shannon: Same as Sian, Kim and bev :)
  [18/2/17, 22:16:07] Shannon: You were from ACSI right
  [18/2/17, 22:16:12] Yi Hein: Yeah
  [18/2/17, 22:16:30] Yi Hein: That patriotism though 😂
  [18/2/17, 22:16:51] Yi Hein: You guys did Lang Arts too right?
  [18/2/17, 22:16:54] Shannon: HAHAH I miss MG
  [18/2/17, 22:16:59] Shannon: Yep
  [18/2/17, 22:17:08] Shannon: It was my worst subject before Chinese HAHA
  [18/2/17, 22:17:24] Yi Hein: Haha same
  [18/2/17, 22:17:41] Yi Hein: My worst subjects are literally Lang Arts, HCl, Malay
  [18/2/17, 22:17:52] Yi Hein: Basically all the languages
  [18/2/17, 22:18:10] Shannon: Oh you took malay?
  [18/2/17, 22:18:18] Shannon: HAHA ya my french was horrid too
  [18/2/17, 22:18:21] Yi Hein: Yeah MSP
  [18/2/17, 22:19:07] Shannon: Actually it wasn't too bad in lower Sec but in upper Sec it suddenly deteriorated until I was struggling to pass HAHA
  [18/2/17, 22:19:21] Shannon: At least I got a B3 :P
  [18/2/17, 22:19:34] Shannon: Did you have to take o levels for Malay?
  [18/2/17, 22:19:39] Yi Hein: Yeah
  [18/2/17, 22:19:52] Yi Hein: Probably my worst nightmare
  [18/2/17, 22:20:23] Yi Hein: I got a C5, surprised I passed though
  [18/2/17, 22:21:29] Yi Hein: I stoned at the teacher for 5 minutes during the oral segment
  [18/2/17, 22:21:42] Yi Hein: So awkward
  [18/2/17, 22:25:05] Shannon: HAHAH congrats!!!
  [18/2/17, 22:26:32] Shannon: Mine was really weird too, the teacher asked me what I liked to read, and I said Harry Potter; and when she asked me who my fav character was, I said that it was Sirius black because he was charming since that was the only adjective I knew
  [18/2/17, 22:27:07] Shannon: For the compo I didn't know a lot of verbs so I came up with them HAHA
  [18/2/17, 22:27:34] Shannon: Third languages are nightmares 😂
  [18/2/17, 22:35:44] Yi Hein: I actually think our questions are the same but just in different languages
  [18/2/17, 22:36:10] Yi Hein: Exactly the same except mine was about a movie and not a book
  [18/2/17, 22:37:08] Yi Hein: Totally agreed, probably second worst mistake after IB
  [18/2/17, 22:58:31] Shannon: I just finished my lang lit essay!!!
  [18/2/17, 22:58:39] Shannon: Oh which movie did you say HAHA
  [18/2/17, 22:59:07] Shannon: I feel like I should've taken an easier third lang like jap HAHA idk french felt very hard
  [18/2/17, 22:59:16] Shannon: Do you regret taking IB?
  [19/2/17, 08:01:38] Yi Hein: Gratz :)
  [19/2/17, 08:02:45] Yi Hein: I was talking about "Suicide Squad" since it was just released then
  [19/2/17, 08:12:28] Yi Hein: But I still feel Malay is easiest to learn of all the languages because of the grammar
  [19/2/17, 08:13:35] Yi Hein: Not now, but probably yes when the workload starts increasing exponentially
  [19/2/17, 08:41:54] Shannon: True, and it's a more useful language than french imo
  [19/2/17, 08:42:07] Shannon: You'll be fine!!! Don't worry too much haha I'm sure you'll be able to cope
  [19/2/17, 08:42:22] Shannon: Btw have you read the great Gatsby yet
  [19/2/17, 08:42:35] Yi Hein: Only the first chapter
  [19/2/17, 08:42:44] Yi Hein: Still have second chapt to read today
  [19/2/17, 10:48:43] Shannon: HAHA sameee
  [19/2/17, 10:48:57] Shannon: Oh right, you were in Nicole's and Lisa's OG right?
  [19/2/17, 11:21:10] Yi Hein: Yup, you know them well?
  [19/2/17, 14:01:25] Shannon: Yep!! They're both my good friends HAHA and Lisa's my second Cousin too :P
  [19/2/17, 14:02:22] Shannon: Did you talk to them?
  [19/2/17, 16:58:31] Yi Hein: Lisa isn't very close to my OG so I don't really know her well
  [19/2/17, 17:02:22] Yi Hein: I know Nicole somewhat well
  [19/2/17, 17:02:56] Yi Hein: She's literally the only person I've ever met with so much energy 😂
  [19/2/17, 17:58:32] Shannon: Ohh yeah lisa is a quiet person
  [19/2/17, 17:59:20] Shannon: HAHA ikr!! And she's so loud!! She sat next to me in Sec 3 and by the end of the term my right ear wasn't working properly
  [19/2/17, 17:59:50] Shannon: And every time I talk to her I have to remind her to use her indoor voice 😂
  [19/2/17, 18:01:06] Shannon: But she's really friendly, she was my first non-IP Friend in Sec 3 (cos she transferred from express)
  [19/2/17, 19:16:07] Yi Hein: Yeah she's one of the few who made my OG really cheerful and uplifting
  [19/2/17, 19:17:52] Yi Hein: Oh I see, didn't know MG also allows express to IP transfers
  [19/2/17, 19:18:08] Yi Hein: I was actually from express too
  [19/2/17, 21:22:51] Shannon: Haha is your OG really bonded? Your OG seems like a nice bunch 👍🏻
  [19/2/17, 21:23:23] Shannon: Oh cool!! Was is hard to get in? I heard that the interview was hard
  [20/2/17, 06:48:03] Yi Hein: I can't really gauge since I was the one who got in haha, but for me the interviewer asked really generic questions
  [20/2/17, 06:49:06] Yi Hein: For others they asked really hard unique questions,  so I'm pretty fortunate
  [20/2/17, 16:33:43] Shannon: Woahh that's really good for you; I think the MGS screening test wasn't that rigorous, particularly because a lot of the good o level people wanted to go to other schools instead of AC
  [20/2/17, 16:34:19] Shannon: Oh right btw for the Chinese thing we only need to decide on the topic by wed right
  [20/2/17, 16:58:03] Yi Hein: Yeah but good to think about it now
  [20/2/17, 17:42:09] Shannon: Yep ofc!! Are you going to create a group or smth? :P
  [20/2/17, 17:42:15] Shannon: Btw did you apply for student council?
  [20/2/17, 17:54:30] Yi Hein: Yeah sounds like an idea
  [20/2/17, 17:54:46] Yi Hein: Yup, did you apply too?
  [20/2/17, 19:10:10] Shannon: Nope I didn't, idk I felt like student council here in AC isn't as meaningful as it was in MG (no offence though!!!)
  [20/2/17, 19:10:35] Shannon: All the best!! I hope you get in HAHA I'll vote for you!
  [20/2/17, 19:11:09] Yi Hein: thanks in advance, haha
  [20/2/17, 19:11:30] Yi Hein: Well I'll make it meaningful if I get in
  [20/2/17, 19:11:48] Shannon: HAHA I'll look forward to that!!
  [20/2/17, 19:14:18] Shannon: Haha don't get me wrong lah, but I just felt like it was more of a position of glamour than one of actual service to the school
  
  I'm not saying that the councillors are snobbish it's just the vibes I get from the whole thing in general
  [20/2/17, 19:14:50] Shannon: But ya you can make it better!! Haha my student leader teacher told me to try and get in and change it but nah, I decided not to :P
  [20/2/17, 19:15:20] Yi Hein: Were you in MG prefectorial board?
  [20/2/17, 19:17:28] Shannon: I was in the student leadership committee!! It's kinda similar, just that the prefects lead from the outside in, while the student leaders lead from the inside out
  [20/2/17, 19:17:31] Shannon: HAHA does that make sense
  [20/2/17, 19:17:34] Yi Hein: I have actually heard a few people telling me the same thing. But for me, I believe as long as my motives are right, I shouldn't miss the opportunity to serve because of what others think about it
  [20/2/17, 19:18:00] Shannon: They merged everything into one board last year though (so my batch was the last one with two separate committees)
  [20/2/17, 19:18:32] Shannon: Yep, that's good!! Haha you can be the change maker, and make it a better council overall :D
  [20/2/17, 19:20:03] Yi Hein: ACSI is trying to start SLC (Student Leadership Committee) too, you have no idea the amount of politics, hate, mean-spiritness that is in the group
  [20/2/17, 19:35:19] Yi Hein: I'm actually very curious about a few things, 
  
  1. What are the reasons that made you feel council is more of a position of glamour than Service to the school
  
  2. What is different about the leadership in MG that makes it more service oriented
  [20/2/17, 19:38:22] Shannon: woah really? What's the diff between the SLC and council then?
  [20/2/17, 19:38:41] Shannon: But why is there so much politics and bad stuff :( it sounds horrid; are you in it?
  [20/2/17, 19:53:15] Shannon: HAHA ok let me try and answer that:
  1) the most obvious reason would be that it really seems like a popularity race. I understand that the student leaders of the school have to be acknowledged by the students as their leaders, and hence the necessity of the voting portion of the election process. However, the campaigning bit is a bit over the top, and seems like a way through which nominees can buy the students' votes. Yes, the population needs to know who they're voting for, but I think a write up/ intro/ speech will do, with the campaigns being unnecessary. In the end, it's only going to be the well liked people, the popular kids, the ones who know the most people who get in, because they have the most friends, the most effective campaigns bc of their supporters and the best connections. Hence, those who become councillors are eventually those who are popular, and are thus in a position of glamour in the school. 
  
  Also, from what I've heard from my MG friends, the people trying for council from MG (not nice people) are all rather confident they'll get in because of their connections... I guess that just showed me how kinda messed up the whole thing is, like it's the popular people who get in and the legit leaders who get kicked out of the running. And the councillors are just the popular kids. And tbh they (those from MG who are gonna try) don't seem like those who are actually good at planning stuff and all, and they prob won't really serve the school with a true heart of thanksgivings, love and gratefulness to the school.
  [20/2/17, 19:54:56] Shannon: ^^idk it might seem very cynical but yeah... tbvvvvvh my batch of MG IP people isn't like 100% nice sadly, we have like a handful of people who just aren't that....good (idk how to describe them, I don't really want to badmouth them HAHA but ya they're just the popular kids stereotype if you get what I mean)
  [20/2/17, 19:55:11] Shannon: The previous batch was very nice though!! Our seniors are really great ✨😞
  [20/2/17, 19:55:26] Shannon: *** 👍🏻 I meant this instead of the sad face sorry!!
  [20/2/17, 20:00:14] Shannon: 2. Okay in MG, the leaders are hardly ever recognised, or acknowledged because we really believe in servant leadership, so whatever we do, we tend to do it behind the scenes and we're not usually thanked or congratulated. And we have to do tons of difficult work, and put up with a lot of difficult things, and it's really tough sometimes, but we find joy in really just serving the school and the people. Even though no one notices, the fact that we helped our school, or just made people's lives easier/ happier, brings us through and gives us strength!! We lead not by standing in the front, but in the shadows, we don't order others around, we do our best to support them and Ensure that the school body is as comfortable and happy as possible. I don't get the feeling from the council in AC, I feel like the people don't have a heart of service and love to the school, and are just doing all the council stuff that cos it's "cool" HAHA, or whatever their other reasons are.
  [20/2/17, 20:00:22] Shannon: HAHA Sorry it's really Long
  [20/2/17, 20:09:44] Yi Hein: Haha it okay, thanks so much it really enlightened me
  [20/2/17, 20:10:47] Yi Hein: I think now I finally understand what my seniors have been telling me about council for years (since Y2)
  [20/2/17, 20:15:32] Yi Hein: It really does show the huge contrast between the leadership body of MG and AC. And I really identify with the leadership model MG has taken up
  [20/2/17, 20:17:23] Yi Hein: You've given me a clearer perspective on council, and perhaps I'm more certain now on what aspects should be changed and what it should be changed to
  [20/2/17, 20:17:36] Yi Hein: ^ that is if I make it to council of course
  [20/2/17, 20:18:59] Yi Hein: It's more of a united leadership body crossing over from all the Uniformed groups
  [20/2/17, 20:20:16] Yi Hein: I'm technically not in SLC yet (since SLC doesn't exist currently),
  but I'm in the discussion group. Perhaps I could show you the group for you to have a clear picture
  [20/2/17, 20:21:37] Yi Hein: I don't really get what you mean by leading from outside in and leading from inside out
  [20/2/17, 22:08:16] Shannon: Haha were they persuading or dissuading you from joining council?
  [20/2/17, 22:08:43] Shannon: 👍🏻 yep it's one that really taught me to mature and grow not only as a leader, but as a person overall!!
  [20/2/17, 22:09:06] Shannon: HAHA that's good!!! I'll support you! I really hope you'll get in, I think you'll do a great job
  [20/2/17, 22:09:25] Shannon: Oh wow, then do you guys plan stuff for all the UGs?
  [20/2/17, 22:09:48] Shannon: HAHA when is it gonna be finalised though? Jiayou though!!!
  [20/2/17, 22:15:53] Shannon: Hmm okay it's kinda like this:
  Leading from the outside in means to lead from the front, you would give instructions to everyone from the top. You're obviously higher up position, so you command authority, "obedience" and respect, and that's why people follow you. You're basically the face of your congregation, and you work in the spotlight where everyone can see. You inspire your people. 
  
  Leading from the inside out means to lead from within the group of people, so you most likely rally them, encourage them and Ensure that they stay on task/ continue moving forward though you don't exactly have to be the one who's in charge. You work mostly in the dark, and though you might not be seen as the leader leader, people would most likely look to you for guidance, support, and as, hopefully, a role model.
  [20/2/17, 22:18:47] Shannon: Diff types of leadership styles!! Imo, you need both for the community to thrive :) you need the first to keep everything in order, and for stability and peace; but you need the second for hope and encouragement when things seem tough-- someone to depend on when it's difficult and to Ensure that everything is ok within the community
  
  Sometimes it's hard for the first group of leaders to understand about how the people really feel, and sometimes it's hard for the second group of leaders to see the larger picture. That's why both need to work together!
  [20/2/17, 22:49:04] Yi Hein: Oh I see, thanks for sharing!
  [21/2/17, 19:20:35] Yi Hein: They were mainly complaining about the selection system and the people who actually get in
  [21/2/17, 19:23:21] Yi Hein: I feel like AC student councils, including past, present and likely the future councils, are lacking people like you.
  [21/2/17, 19:28:09] Yi Hein: You are with no doubt, the kindest, most selfless, humble person I've ever met in school. And before knowing you I honestly didn't think it was possible
  [21/2/17, 19:29:59] Yi Hein: I really admire how you remain so grounded to your values and moral judgement, with an unwavering passion to serve others
  [21/2/17, 19:33:59] Yi Hein: It really is tough to be working behind the scenes, leading in the shadows, and yet sometimes not being appreciated by others. And I guess since you are able to do it in MG, it really does show your selfless, humble and steadfast character
  [21/2/17, 19:38:46] Yi Hein: Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to convince you to join council, I know that you've decided to look into other avenues to serve the school. But I just want to say that there's so much I look up to you, and there's so much I have yet to learn from you
  [21/2/17, 19:44:57] Yi Hein: I know that my journey applying for council, and hopefully making a change in council will be a arduous one. Especially with when people with ill intentions and various personalities will be inside
  [21/2/17, 19:47:41] Yi Hein: This is whole chunk of message is extremely weird, but I hope that should my motives, intentions and moral values shift during my journey, you can help guide and remind me?
  [21/2/17, 21:27:12] Shannon: Hihi sorry for the late reply my mum was angry with me and I was trying to make her happy again
  [21/2/17, 21:27:13] Shannon: 😭
  [21/2/17, 21:30:16] Shannon: Anyway!! HAHA awww that's v nice of you but I'm sure that there will be a fraction of the councillors who get in who are legit good leaders (like you!!), so I hope that if/ when you get in, you'll be able to lead the rest well and just make the system better :D
  [21/2/17, 21:32:35] Shannon: Nahhh that's not true!! Idk, I think if I were really a good person I would try for council like you with the right mindset and all, hoping to make everything better; but I'm instead choosing the easier path of inaction and criticism which doesn't actually do much help haha, and plus I just don't really want to work with all those popular people (sorry to stereotype idk how else to describe them) who get in cos knowing me I'll get really frustrated and angry HAHA; so the true selfless and humble person is you!
  [21/2/17, 21:34:26] Shannon: HAHAH anyway it's too late for me to join council already. Honestly I don't think there's much you can learn from me, the greatest leader I can think of is Jesus!! (Are you Christian though?) and, I think anyone can be a true leader as Long as they have the heart and capacity to serve (like you do!!). But ofc if you need advice or anything I'll be here yeah
  [21/2/17, 21:35:44] Shannon: Yeppp it'll definitely be tough, but I'm sure you'll do well!! I'll support you HAHA have faith in yourself!! Just make sure you always keep your values close to your heart bc really, that's the most important thing; don't let anything waver your heart
  [21/2/17, 21:35:56] Shannon: Ofc!!! Sure, I'll always be there for you when you need me :)
  [21/2/17, 21:38:50] Yi Hein: I'm not actually Christian though, I was raised by Buddhist values by my grandparents but I'm not Buddhist either. So I'm a free thinker
  [21/2/17, 21:56:04] Yi Hein: Its understandable why joining council is not a good idea, I mean like my seniors from a few years ago literally said, "Be *very* careful of the people around you if you were to join council". And perhaps it is a much better idea to not join council, but being the rebel that I am I've decided to join. I've really wanted to make a positive change in council, for the school and the community. But with the "political and social climate" within council, I'm afraid that I'll be negatively influenced and steer away from my goal.
  [21/2/17, 22:00:09] Yi Hein: To be honest, you've probably not seen it yet but I can be pretty selfish, ignorant and unkind at times. That's why I was saying you're the best person to make a change
  [21/2/17, 22:44:47] Shannon: Ohh okay, I was raised as a Buddhist too! Then I became a Christian, so I'm the only Christian in my family now haha
  [21/2/17, 22:53:38] Shannon: Haha I think what you're doing is really respectable and good though!! But yeah, the MG people who signed up for council this year aren't the legit people (as expected sigh), and I've seen my fair share of good people who become bad cos of bad company :( I Guess 近朱者赤，近墨者黑, so yep, it'll be really important for you to be steadfast and strong if you get in!! I'm sure you'll be fine but yep I'll be here for you too :)
  [21/2/17, 22:56:59] Yi Hein: Thank you 😊
  [21/2/17, 23:12:32] Shannon: All the best for your competition tmr btw!!
  [21/2/17, 23:13:05] Shannon: Oh and HAHA you're like the first legit Friend I made in AC this year 😂
  [22/2/17, 19:27:51] Shannon: Hey Yi Hein how long is your essay 😭
  [22/2/17, 19:34:07] Yi Hein: Mine is only one and a quarter of a page without leaving lines
  [22/2/17, 19:34:24] Yi Hein: I've no idea how I'm gonna lengthen it
  [22/2/17, 19:50:57] Shannon: Same :((
  [22/2/17, 19:51:04] Shannon: I think I'm just gonna leave it HAHA
  [22/2/17, 19:54:08] Yi Hein: Me too haha, I've got too much work still not done
  [22/2/17, 20:49:36] Shannon: Oh right btw the econs teacher said that we didn't have to do the essay HAHA
  [22/2/17, 20:53:11] Yi Hein: Lol haha
  [22/2/17, 20:53:18] Yi Hein: Anything else I missed today?
  [22/2/17, 20:57:23] Shannon: Uhh during math the teacher went through the sigma notation briefly, basically everything that he covered is on pg 6 of the math book, if you don't get anything you can ask me tmr :)
  
  He also proved two of the formulas for us, which are standard results 5 and 6 (according to the math book) (actually he just did 5, and told us to do 6 based on his method for 5), I'll take a pic of it for you later!!
  [22/2/17, 20:58:07] Shannon: During econs the teacher revised whatever was covered during the lecture, and she started on demand (I can take pic of my notes for you too!)
  [22/2/17, 20:58:52] Shannon: During bio the teacher did an intro on cell theory but he didn't cover much
  [22/2/17, 20:59:44] Shannon: During TOK we split into the two groups, if you're in the oranges team you have mr phee, if you're in the apples team you have the other guy (forgot his name)
  [22/2/17, 21:00:32] Shannon: And during Chinese the teacher went through the written assignment, gave us hw, and revised the format for 演讲稿 (the normal Chinese people didn't learn it) and 议论文
  [22/2/17, 21:00:37] Shannon: That's it!!

  [22/2/17, 21:05:34] Yi Hein: Thank you so much!
  [22/2/17, 21:05:59] Yi Hein: Your notes are on an another level of neat
  [22/2/17, 21:07:41] Yi Hein: Btw are you oranges or Apple?
  [22/2/17, 21:08:55] Shannon: HAHAHA thanks
  [22/2/17, 21:09:02] Shannon: Oranges!!
  [22/2/17, 21:09:09] Shannon: You?
  [22/2/17, 21:25:56] Yi Hein: Oranges too!
  [22/2/17, 21:31:38] Shannon: Oh yay!! Haha, we have to go out of class for TOK; when we were supposed to decide which half had to go out, our group kept insisting that they wanted to go out cos that way we would get mr phee (apparently he's a better teacher idk)
  [22/2/17, 21:36:18] Shannon: Oh yeah!!! Forgot to include: the teacher showed us an easier method for the Super complicated 3 + 33 + 333 question
  ‎[22/2/17, 21:36:24] Shannon: ‎image omitted
  [22/2/17, 21:47:58] Yi Hein: Oh I see
  [22/2/17, 21:48:03] Yi Hein: That much simpler
  [22/2/17, 21:48:35] Yi Hein: I can never understand how other come up with these genius methods
  [22/2/17, 22:04:32] Shannon: HAHAHAH ikr!!! Idek how people think of these stuff
  [22/2/17, 22:04:46] Shannon: Have you finished the AP/ GP worksheet?
  [22/2/17, 22:06:16] Yi Hein: No, I did a few questions and then gave up and moved on to other assignments
  [23/2/17, 17:35:54] Yi Hein: Hey Shannon, just saw your snap
  [23/2/17, 17:36:01] Yi Hein: Are you okay? That looks really painful
  [23/2/17, 17:36:51] Yi Hein: Rinse it gently with water add a gauze and tape it on 4 sides
  [23/2/17, 17:37:17] Yi Hein: And apply direct pressure to stop the bleeding
  [23/2/17, 18:05:33] Shannon: HAHAHHAA yeah I'm fine!!! Thanks for asking though :P it was q painful but I've been through worse, and it's much better now after it stopped bleeding :D
  [23/2/17, 18:05:49] Shannon: It was really embarrassing when I fell though HAHAHA I hope no one I knew saw it
  [23/2/17, 18:06:29] Yi Hein: Haha glad to hear it's fine
  [23/2/17, 18:06:55] Yi Hein: You fell when getting home?
  [23/2/17, 18:39:09] Shannon: HAHA I fell at the spa frame
  [23/2/17, 18:39:12] Shannon: *space frame
  [23/2/17, 18:40:04] Shannon: Idek how I fell, I was walking and then the ground accelerated towards me 😂 I couldn't even break my fall so now I have a bruise on my chin too, it was Super embarrassing
  [23/2/17, 19:07:14] Yi Hein: Is falling really that embarrassing? Haha I don't get why though
  [23/2/17, 19:12:18] Yi Hein: In year1-4, we did really crazy and stupid stuff. Like people fall for trying to climb over fences and walls, fall while sliding on railings, jumping down a flight of stairs. And perhaps the most common is to slide tackle someone at full speed on the AstroTurf, which most often leads to one guy having a fracture arm/leg
  [23/2/17, 19:28:17] Shannon: HAHAHAHA nah it's not the falling itself that's embarrassing it's the tripping over nothing and then hurting myself that's quite embarrassing 😂
  [23/2/17, 19:28:27] Shannon: HAHAHA omg slide tackling?? What's that
  ‎[23/2/17, 19:38:42] Yi Hein: ‎GIF omitted
  [23/2/17, 22:13:39] Shannon: OH WOW that looks violent and scary HAHAH
  [23/2/17, 22:13:47] Shannon: It must hurt
  [23/2/17, 22:14:03] Shannon: Btw, do you find it hard to follow the chem teacher's lessons
  [23/2/17, 23:22:31] Yi Hein: I find it quite okay
  [23/2/17, 23:23:13] Yi Hein: Probably because stuff like back titration was covered in Y4 already so it was basically a repeat
  [23/2/17, 23:23:32] Yi Hein: I do find math lessons incredibly hard to follow
  [23/2/17, 23:31:08] Shannon: HAHAHA idk I find it very hard to follow and understand what the teacher is saying
  [23/2/17, 23:32:23] Shannon: I think it's the way she says stuff, like she says everything so forcefully, it's like repetitive punches, and she keeps breaking the words into half which is Super unnerving 😭
  [23/2/17, 23:33:04] Yi Hein: Hahahahaha
  [23/2/17, 23:33:05] Shannon: I get the content though cos we learnt it alr but I'm kinda worried about understanding the new topics she's teaching
  [23/2/17, 23:33:41] Yi Hein: Me and Jordan couldn't stop laughing when she started breaking every word up
  [23/2/17, 23:34:13] Shannon: I think math is okay cos I like math HAHA, but chem.... I didn't particularly like the subject but now the teacher is so 😞
  [23/2/17, 23:34:25] Shannon: HAHA ikr!!!! Same so that's why I can't follow
  [23/2/17, 23:35:24] Yi Hein: How do you like math though, I always get pissed when a fail over and over again when doing assignment questions
  [23/2/17, 23:36:37] Yi Hein: Yeah agreed, and her teaching style seemed rather one sided to me
  [23/2/17, 23:37:11] Yi Hein: But she did raise rather interesting points that other teacher probably won't even mention
  [24/2/17, 00:14:04] Shannon: HAHAHA idk I feel like doing math is really calming because everything just makes sense in a logical way, there's no unexpected surprises or any random twists; I just find comfort in the regularity
  [24/2/17, 00:14:08] Shannon: ^does that sound weird
  [24/2/17, 00:14:16] Shannon: I think I'm gonna sleep late today
  [24/2/17, 00:14:30] Shannon: True!!
  [24/2/17, 00:14:41] Shannon: Sigh I really hope I won't flunk chem...
  [24/2/17, 00:19:33] Yi Hein: Hahahaha I am reading this after getting stuck at a question for 30 minutes
  [24/2/17, 00:19:55] Yi Hein: I think I'll try again tomorrow
  [24/2/17, 00:20:05] Yi Hein: *ill try again later today
  [24/2/17, 00:20:29] Shannon: OMG sorry haha I Guess people are all diff
  [24/2/17, 00:20:38] Shannon: Chem is sad :((
  [24/2/17, 00:21:03] Shannon: Btw did you do the 理解问答
  [24/2/17, 00:21:08] Shannon: And how was your LL essay
  [24/2/17, 00:21:16] Yi Hein: Nope
  [24/2/17, 00:21:38] Yi Hein: It took me like 3 hours to finish it, with some research and stuff
  [24/2/17, 00:21:56] Yi Hein: But I still think it's quite bad, hoping it's worth more than a 5 though
  [24/2/17, 00:22:53] Yi Hein: Gtg need to get some rest now
  [24/2/17, 00:23:04] Shannon: HAHAHA good night!!!
  [24/2/17, 00:23:09] Shannon: See you tmr/ later
  [24/2/17, 00:25:14] Yi Hein: Yeah good night
  [24/2/17, 01:13:13] Shannon: I'm sure it'll be fine!!! Haha she'll see how much effort you put into it 👍🏻
  [24/2/17, 15:37:14] Shannon: Hey how was the student leader briefing!! Did you go for the uni talk btw
  [24/2/17, 15:37:39] Yi Hein: I didn't go for Uni talk, had to rush to CCA
  [24/2/17, 15:38:01] Yi Hein: The SC briefing was mainly about details on the duty mentorship phase they are having
  [24/2/17, 15:38:23] Yi Hein: But I'm quite worried cause apparently my name wasn't on the list of applicants
  [24/2/17, 15:38:41] Shannon: Oh no why wasn't it there?
  [24/2/17, 15:38:42] Yi Hein: Hopefully they'll get back to me soon
  [24/2/17, 15:38:57] Shannon: Did you get the return email thing that they said you had to screenshot
  [24/2/17, 15:39:00] Yi Hein: Perhaps some admin screw up on their side
  [24/2/17, 15:39:08] Yi Hein: Yeah
  [24/2/17, 15:39:28] Shannon: Oh then you should be fine!!! Don't worry! I really hope you get in HAHA
  [24/2/17, 15:39:35] Shannon: What's the duty mentorship phase?
  [24/2/17, 15:39:38] Yi Hein: Did no one else from our class sign up for council?
  [24/2/17, 15:40:00] Shannon: Idk about the guys but I don't think any of the girls did!
  [24/2/17, 15:40:19] Yi Hein: We're expected to follow a student councillor mentor for morning duties, like chasing people out of class
  [24/2/17, 15:40:37] Shannon: Actually I'm not sure maybe they did sign up but the last time I asked none of them were really interested
  [24/2/17, 15:41:00] Yi Hein: On the list, there wasn't a single person from 5.13
  [24/2/17, 15:41:22] Shannon: HAHA oh well, I guess you can be our sole councillor
  [24/2/17, 15:41:37] Yi Hein: Quite an abnormally cause other classes all had about 10 people applying
  [24/2/17, 15:41:48] Yi Hein: Haha I guess it's just ASP class
  [24/2/17, 15:41:56] Shannon: TBH I kinda want to join class comm instead :P idk if that's what the rest are thinking
  [24/2/17, 15:42:27] Shannon: Oh wow, that's like about 160 people overall, and then only 30 people are gonna be selected right?
  [24/2/17, 15:42:39] Shannon: Gosh that's so intense
  [24/2/17, 15:42:43] Shannon: All the best!!!!
  [24/2/17, 15:43:08] Yi Hein: There's 136 + 1 people applying, yeah it's a really strict selection process
  [24/2/17, 15:43:51] Shannon: Is there an interview?
  [24/2/17, 15:44:13] Yi Hein: There's a selection camp at end of march to scale the numbers down to 64
  [24/2/17, 15:44:27] Yi Hein: Then there's elections to cut down to final 32
  [24/2/17, 15:44:59] Yi Hein: I think interviews should be incorporated in the selection camp
  [24/2/17, 15:46:23] Yi Hein: Thanks! I'll focus on getting past the camp for now
  [24/2/17, 16:10:03] Shannon: Ohh okay
  [24/2/17, 16:10:24] Shannon: Yep you'll cross the bridge when you come to it :)
  [24/2/17, 16:10:51] Shannon: This is really random but!!! I'm gonna quit photog HAHAHA
  [24/2/17, 16:46:22] Yi Hein: Why did you choose to quit? What are you joining then?
  [24/2/17, 20:59:05] Shannon: I felt like the atmosphere in photog is really stifling and suffocating; it's really rigid
  [24/2/17, 21:00:41] Shannon: I dunno, it's just the vibes I keep getting every time I go for a meeting, and the people don't seem very friendly HAHA
  [24/2/17, 21:00:54] Shannon: I'm probably gonna join Netball recreational!
  [24/2/17, 21:16:58] Yi Hein: Hmm... could it be just maybe you guys don't know each other well yet?
  [24/2/17, 21:17:29] Yi Hein: Do you find the atmosphere in AC unwelcoming?
  [24/2/17, 21:37:23] Shannon: HAHAHA idk maybe! I dunno, it's just the overall feel I get from the whole group, and I'm q a sensitive person so I get affected by these kind of stuff easily 😓
  [24/2/17, 21:45:45] Shannon: TBH I did, and it was really scary and horrid during orientation, I didn't talk to many people + I even had a panic attack once 
  
  But I think our class is really nice!!! Haha I felt much more at ease once school started
  [24/2/17, 21:46:50] Shannon: Idk I just really didn't click well with my OG
  [24/2/17, 21:58:15] Yi Hein: Perhaps that gave a really bad first experience for you. It really depends on who's in your orientation group I guess
  [24/2/17, 21:59:32] Yi Hein: For me it was kind of the opposite, my orientation group was really fun and uplifting, but for our class it feel like it is a bit too competitive (especially those who were from ACS class)
  [24/2/17, 22:00:29] Yi Hein: Was you OG really competitive? Cause you mentioned that you felt the school had a competitive atmosphere
  [24/2/17, 22:12:48] Shannon: HAHA yeah it was q bad but I have a habit of forgetting bad memories so I've kinda forgotten 80% of orientation already
  [24/2/17, 22:15:46] Yi Hein: I feel it's quite sad cause orientation is supposed to be fun but many of my friends didn't enjoy it either
  [24/2/17, 22:16:38] Shannon: Yeah my OG was Super competitive and intense; they really _really_ wanted to get first; this guy was like "if anyone gets in the way of our OG winning, I'll punch them idc who they are!!!" And on the mass games day he said "during capture the flag let's not just tap the people to get them out, we must shove them to the ground so that there's a higher chance of injury and they'll be out of the game"
  [24/2/17, 22:16:44] Shannon: ^^^ scary right
  [24/2/17, 22:17:08] Yi Hein: Holy crap, that's actually quite bad
  [24/2/17, 22:17:11] Shannon: And he kept shouting and me cos I was pretty much useless HAHA
  [24/2/17, 22:17:14] Shannon: *at
  [24/2/17, 22:18:07] Shannon: It was insane, I spent as much time as I could away from my OG haha so I mostly went to my friends' OGs
  [24/2/17, 22:18:13] Yi Hein: That's really unkind... my OG was probably the polar opposite
  [24/2/17, 22:19:24] Shannon: Yeah ik!! Nicole kept saying that we should've switched places HAHA (though I bet your OG would've less fun without her) cos she would fit in with my more enthusiastic and intense group
  [24/2/17, 22:20:07] Yi Hein: For me, my OG was probably one of the nicest cause nobody bothered to try and win, so during Games 1 and 2 we were losing and drawing all our matches but everyone was still in high spirits, cause we just wanted to have fun before IB. But the biggest irony is that, being probably the least competitive OG, we won almost every single game for the ACSiting Race, and won overall.
  [24/2/17, 22:20:51] Yi Hein: Yeah Nicole was probably the one that pulled the OG together
  [24/2/17, 22:21:40] Shannon: HAHAHAH that's really cool though!!! I think your OG was really good (a lot of my close friends were in it too haha)
  [24/2/17, 22:21:43] Shannon: Do you miss it?
  [24/2/17, 22:22:19] Shannon: Haha when the teacher was talking about how some people would never get over their OG I was just like nope not me
  [24/2/17, 22:23:38] Yi Hein: Yeah I kind of the experiences within the OG
  [24/2/17, 22:24:40] Yi Hein: But well, I still see my OG mates everyday in school and it's really nice having them as friends
  [24/2/17, 22:25:53] Yi Hein: *i kind of miss the experiences
  [24/2/17, 22:26:27] Shannon: Ohh that's good for you!!
  [24/2/17, 22:26:37] Yi Hein: It really depends on who is in the OG, that creates the overall mood
  [24/2/17, 22:27:02] Shannon: Yeah HAHA but I Guess everyone plays a part in making the OG enjoyable and I can't exactly say I did my part anyway
  [24/2/17, 22:27:24] Shannon: So I Guess I'm partly at fault for making myself have a miserable time :P
  [24/2/17, 22:28:12] Yi Hein: I think it's just a conflict of personality, so like perhaps people in your OG couldn't relate to each other
  [24/2/17, 22:28:29] Yi Hein: Which would naturally lead to unfriendliness
  [24/2/17, 22:29:27] Shannon: HAHA at least the rest of them had a good time together I think, and they're all quite good friends now so I feel happy for them
  [24/2/17, 22:30:14] Shannon: I can't even be seen in the OG photos HAHAHA I bet they'd forget that I was in their OG by next year 😂
  [24/2/17, 22:30:44] Yi Hein: 😔
  [24/2/17, 22:30:49] Shannon: Orientation was still kinda okay at some parts though!! Cos I got to hang out a lot with my old friends and all HAHAH
  [24/2/17, 22:31:38] Shannon: Sorry does that make me sound very pathetic 😓nicole keeps telling me not to be so pessimistic when it comes to myself HAHA
  [24/2/17, 22:32:02] Shannon: Idk I always see myself as an optimistic person though 🤔
  [24/2/17, 22:32:11] Shannon: Oops sorry I'm rambling 😓
  [24/2/17, 22:32:27] Yi Hein: Haha no it doesn't really seem pessimistic
  [24/2/17, 22:33:53] Yi Hein: I feel like you cared more about others enjoying themselves than you actually thinking about enjoying?
  [24/2/17, 22:34:47] Yi Hein: Shows how you always think about others first too
  [24/2/17, 22:35:36] Yi Hein: Well I'm glad that you like our current class, cause our class will be together for our entire IB journey
  [24/2/17, 22:37:37] Yi Hein: I feel quite fortunate too being in this class. Cause I keep on hearing from my OGmates about how bad their class is
  [24/2/17, 22:38:41] Shannon: HAHA nah I was just afraid that my reservation about the group would dampen their overall experience (though I guess it kinda did cos I played a role in them not winning overall) which would be q selfish of me and unfair to them
  [24/2/17, 22:41:11] Shannon: Idk I'm usually only friendly when I'm around people I'm comfortable with, and no one made me feel welcome in the OG haha; I wasn't close to any of the MG girls (like I was friends with them but i hardly talked to them, and I had some friendship issue with one last year haha), so that's why I never got to assimilate well into my OH
  [24/2/17, 22:41:13] Shannon: *OG
  [24/2/17, 22:45:32] Shannon: Yeah!! I feel like the people are very nice, and though sometimes I feel slightly inferior, I just tell myself that it's fine bc God created me as I am :D
  [24/2/17, 22:45:56] Shannon: Ikr!! Quite a few of my friends don't like their class, and miss their OG too :(
  [25/2/17, 15:04:45] Yi Hein: I can't emphasise it enough but you are the most altruistic person I've ever met
  [25/2/17, 15:12:44] Yi Hein: And speaking about being selfless, I need your advice/opinion on something that happened, cause it's haunting me and I feel really guilty
  [25/2/17, 15:32:23] Shannon: Oh no what happened :(
  [25/2/17, 15:36:50] Yi Hein: So I was at the bus stop when a middle aged Indian man approached me and asked for money to buy food
  [25/2/17, 15:38:20] Yi Hein: I didn't know what to do, so I asked him how much he needed and he requested for $10
  [25/2/17, 15:39:24] Yi Hein: And I told him I couldn't give him $10 and told him to ask someone else
  [25/2/17, 15:41:00] Yi Hein: I want to know whats your perspective on it, cause I'm really confused and in a dilemma
  [25/2/17, 15:41:47] Yi Hein: and perhaps what would you have done?
  [25/2/17, 16:27:18] Shannon: Hmm in my opinion, I don't think you did anything wrong, so you don't have to beat yourself up over it. 
  
  I get why you feel guilty, bc you couldn't help him, but honestly to me, $10 is a big sum of money, and really, no one expects you to donate it to him! The fact that you asked him how much he needed shows that you actually did care about his situation, and was willing to give him a sum of money if you could; that already reflects that you are a good person (at least in my book!). Honestly, I think most people would've just ignored him, avoided him or just shooed him away, so really, you don't have to beat yourself up!! You're a good person through and through so don't worry about it :)
  
  I understand that you feel guilty bc you couldn't help him, and frankly speaking, there's really nothing you can do to now (except pray for him but you're not Christian haha). True, your $10 could've helped him have a meal today, and _perhaps_ he would have to skip a meal now, but really, it's okay. It's not your fault, so don't blame yourself! I'm not saying that you should maintain the "I can't help so I don't care" attitude now, but rather, I mean that instead of looking inward regarding the issue now, you can look outwards and think of ways you can help others next time. If you couldn't do it this time, you can do it next time :) 
  
  I know it'll be really hard to get rid of the guilt (to me, guilt is like a red stain on a white tablecloth-- it's so painfully obvious and no matter what you do it'll always be there, as a a reminder of a mistake), so you should try to use that guilt and turn it into something positive. Instead of beating yourself up, you can do more good/ kind deeds to others as a penance to the man, although you shouldn't do good deeds just so that you'll let yourself feel better, I think this will definitely ease your heart. 
  
  I'm not sure if this will be helpful to you, but I just hope that you won't beat yourself up and degrade yourself over this incident.
  [25/2/17, 16:30:53] Shannon: Hm I'm not sure if you saw my wallet when I showed it to Beverly but I'm seriously broke, I don't have much money in my wallet bc I keep lending it to people; so I wouldn't have had $10 to give him either. I would give him whatever money I had _if_ I could though (I.e If i didn't need the money), if not, I would have apologised and told him I didn't have enough money. Honestly, I don't think I would feel bad if I didn't give him any money bc I wasn't being selfish or lying. I would say a short prayer for him and hope that he would be able to get enough to have a meal
  [25/2/17, 16:33:21] Shannon: Don't worry Yi Hein!! If you're afraid that your act was selfish, or maybe even self-centered, I don't think so, and seriously, you're a very nice moral person! So don't worry too much okay? :)
  [25/2/17, 16:52:41] Yi Hein: Thanks for your advice and taking time to type this!
  [25/2/17, 17:14:45] Yi Hein: I'll try to be as honest as I can. I don't consider myself to be selfless, and you will start to understand that with time. But that is also why I admire you so much. You'll always help others without hesitation, and only consider you own needs later. The truth is, I had enough money to give it to the man, and I didn't need the money. I was given the choice and I chose to not give him the money. It's probably because I don't think is going to help him, as I don't think it is a sustainable way of living. Like giving him money only gives temporary relief. And on the other hand, I feel like I don't have the right to give money since the money is not mine, but my parent's. But I felt like I missed the opportunity make a change to his life, even if it doesn't involve money. And that's probably the part I regretted most.
  [25/2/17, 17:15:26] Yi Hein: What you said really helped me clear my thoughts and reflect
  [25/2/17, 17:16:51] Yi Hein: But as you can already observe, I would consider myself before considering others and perhaps that's one of my flaws
  [25/2/17, 17:18:16] Yi Hein: Hopefully next time when I had another chance I would be able to difference for others
  [25/2/17, 17:36:30] Shannon: Ohh that's another way of thinking though! Like it wouldn't really be helping him, but it does also show that you do care about him, but in a diff way!!
  [25/2/17, 17:36:34] Shannon: Haha Glad I could help :)
  [25/2/17, 17:36:57] Shannon: Yep!! That's a good attitude to have
  [25/2/17, 17:37:57] Shannon: If everyone could care about each other, and put others before themselves, everyone would live so happily haha
  [25/2/17, 18:56:29] Yi Hein: Yeah, haha well if there were 7 billion Shannons world peace would be achieved
  [26/2/17, 09:39:52] Yi Hein: Whoops sry accidentally pressed call
  [26/2/17, 09:40:12] Yi Hein: Btw how's the concert yesterday?
  [26/2/17, 11:06:36] Shannon: HAHA it's fine!!
  [26/2/17, 11:06:55] Shannon: It was really cool!!! The stage effects were great, and the lighting was so awesome haha
  [26/2/17, 11:07:34] Shannon: And our seats were really good, so we could see 张学友 up close it was kinda surreal HAHA
  [26/2/17, 11:07:44] Shannon: What kind of music do you like though
  [26/2/17, 12:17:41] Yi Hein: Woah, i saw your snap, looks amazing!
  [26/2/17, 12:19:11] Yi Hein: I don't really listen to music frequently, but i like calm soothing music
  [26/2/17, 18:47:30] Yi Hein: Hey Shannon, for the Chinese Compo, did Mdm Xu say we must strictly follow the word limit or is it just a guide
  [26/2/17, 18:52:20] Shannon: Must follow :((
  [26/2/17, 18:52:32] Shannon: Max is 480, i think they will deduct marks if you exceed it
  [26/2/17, 18:52:54] Shannon: It's really short right sigh
  [26/2/17, 18:56:50] Yi Hein: Yeah probably means they are looking out for quality which makes it all the more harder
  [26/2/17, 19:52:05] Shannon: Ikr sighhh
  [26/2/17, 19:52:10] Shannon: I think mine was a bit odd
  [26/2/17, 19:52:15] Shannon: Btw is there any bio homework due?
  [26/2/17, 19:53:13] Yi Hein: there homework given but there no assigned due date
  [26/2/17, 19:53:36] Yi Hein: the cells worksheet probably not due anytime soon since he have not finished the chapter
  [26/2/17, 19:54:00] Yi Hein: we're supposed to do the lab worksheet though
  [26/2/17, 19:56:39] Shannon: Okay thanks!! Is the lab worksheet the one where we had to look at the microscope and stuff
  [26/2/17, 19:58:16] Yi Hein: yup, its the one with a cell with microvilli on the front apge
  [26/2/17, 20:07:09] Shannon: Okay thanks!!
  [26/2/17, 20:13:27] Yi Hein: np :)
  [27/2/17, 20:31:13] Yi Hein: Hey Shannon, this is pretty ironic asking you but, when's the Lang Lit TGG essay due
  [27/2/17, 20:32:50] Shannon: HAHAHA Thursday!!
  [27/2/17, 20:32:57] Shannon: And I haven't even finished reading the book
  [27/2/17, 20:32:59] Shannon: I'm dead
  [27/2/17, 21:14:21] Yi Hein: Hahaha, I've only read chapter 1 and I need to reread cause I didn't understand it well
  [27/2/17, 21:15:01] Yi Hein: Looks like I'm going to get slayed by her again...
  [27/2/17, 21:50:16] Shannon: HAHAHAHA I just realised that the essay must be based on chapter 1 and 2 so maybe I'm not dead yet
  [27/2/17, 21:50:24] Shannon: It's okay!! My essay is probably worse than yours
  [27/2/17, 21:50:33] Shannon: I hope she doesn't publicly shame me tmr or something
  [27/2/17, 21:50:48] Yi Hein: Hahaha me too
  [27/2/17, 21:51:07] Yi Hein: I still fail to understand how TGG is considered interesting
  [27/2/17, 21:51:43] Yi Hein: There's like half a page of description of a house
  [27/2/17, 21:52:22] Yi Hein: And now I'm reading pages after pages of trivial conversations
  [27/2/17, 22:35:44] Shannon: HAHAHAHA
  [27/2/17, 22:36:09] Shannon: I find the metaphors and similes used very over the top and sometimes a bit hard to decipher
  ‎[27/2/17, 22:36:22] Shannon: ‎image omitted
  [27/2/17, 22:36:26] Shannon: I feel bad
  [27/2/17, 22:37:25] Yi Hein: Well if I were you I would be honest and say the environment is not suitable
  [27/2/17, 22:37:37] Yi Hein: Or you can say our interest has changed
  [27/2/17, 22:37:59] Yi Hein: *your interest has changed
  [27/2/17, 22:39:28] Shannon: Okay!!! Thanksss
  [27/2/17, 22:39:41] Shannon: Sigh I feel like I was very unproductive today
  [27/2/17, 22:39:50] Yi Hein: Haha me too
  [27/2/17, 22:40:06] Yi Hein: Don't think I'll be sleeping early tonight 😔
  [27/2/17, 22:40:16] Yi Hein: Hey btw do you know who Joel Mui is?
  [1/3/17, 11:06:23] Shannon: School mag :((((( is very sad :((((
  [1/3/17, 12:29:06] Yi Hein: Is it because of Micheal Hee?
  [1/3/17, 13:22:08] Shannon: Nahh not just him it's just that I'm the only girl so it's really awkward
  [1/3/17, 13:22:17] Shannon: (Talking to guys is scary HAHA)
  [1/3/17, 13:22:27] Shannon: And I didn't really understand what was going on
  [1/3/17, 13:22:44] Shannon: Btw I asked the bio teacher and he said to just fill up the worksheet for the "lab report" due this week!
  [1/3/17, 14:17:27] Yi Hein: Oh haha makes sense
  [1/3/17, 14:17:54] Yi Hein: I'll feel really uncomfortable if I were you
  [1/3/17, 14:19:08] Yi Hein: Yay :)
  [1/3/17, 14:20:12] Yi Hein: You confirm you're joining Netball?
  [2/3/17, 00:10:34] Yi Hein: Finally managed to memorise it
  [2/3/17, 19:45:32] Shannon: Oh how was track and field?
  [2/3/17, 19:45:50] Shannon: HAHA sorry didn't see your message; I think there's a 80% chance I will join Netball :P
  [2/3/17, 19:46:00] Shannon: Unless the Michael Heah guy somehow manages to convince me HAHAH
  [2/3/17, 19:46:14] Shannon: Do you think it's kinda cowardly to quit school mag
  [2/3/17, 19:46:27] Shannon: Just cos I feel Super burden and uncomfortable haha
  [2/3/17, 20:32:21] Yi Hein: I honestly think if you don't like the environment there's no point forcing yourself to stay
  [2/3/17, 20:33:27] Yi Hein: I don't really know Michael Heah but sometimes you should give them time before making judgements...(flashback to TGG hahaha)
  [2/3/17, 20:33:46] Yi Hein: But it is pretty weird since your the only girl
  [2/3/17, 20:34:36] Yi Hein: It's not cowardly at all...I mean like no ones gonna judge you for quitting something you don't like
  [2/3/17, 20:35:15] Yi Hein: I don't know why but I feel that Netball will probably be more welcoming for you
  [2/3/17, 20:35:47] Yi Hein: Pretty bad :((
  [2/3/17, 20:36:42] Yi Hein: And it's not because I ran slowly. It's because after running 5k, they told me they didn't record my time and DQed me
  [2/3/17, 20:38:33] Yi Hein: And then I tried to give some suggestions so that others won't experience the same thing as me.
  [2/3/17, 20:39:25] Yi Hein: And I got scolded pretty badly by the teacher because I have no "authority to give suggestions on how to run the event" and my "feedback is not needed"
  [2/3/17, 21:17:14] Shannon: HAHAHA true true idk I'm q a judgemental person (see I'm not that nice a person :P)
  [2/3/17, 21:18:30] Shannon: Same!!! Cos all my friends are there hahaha
  [2/3/17, 21:19:05] Shannon: What????? That's really unprofessional and bad
  [2/3/17, 21:19:18] Shannon: Oh no.... that teacher sounds so scary :(((
  [2/3/17, 21:19:48] Shannon: Oh dear
  [2/3/17, 21:20:04] Shannon: Don't be too upset okay!!!
  [2/3/17, 21:20:39] Shannon: Idk some people are just really narrow minded and don't want to listen to others
  [2/3/17, 21:24:07] Yi Hein: After what he did it's pretty insane not to judge him, unless the person is so clueless
  [2/3/17, 21:27:31] Yi Hein: Yeah I'll try. Today was pretty horrible for me though. Like even for the house captain selection. After seeing the results, I'm like okay, if there's a person who is more suitable to serve the house, it's for the best. But I got really upset when I found out it was rigged for my house
  [2/3/17, 21:28:14] Shannon: Oh you tried for house cap?
  [2/3/17, 21:28:16] Yi Hein: It's actually surprising how I always ask you for moral advice now 😂
  [2/3/17, 21:28:17] Shannon: It was rigged?
  [2/3/17, 21:28:54] Yi Hein: Yeah, not for other houses (at least I would like to think). But definitely rigged for my house
  [2/3/17, 21:29:02] Yi Hein: But I've got over it
  [2/3/17, 21:29:13] Shannon: What.... that's Super corrupted....
  [2/3/17, 21:29:21] Shannon: How did you know it was rigged though
  [2/3/17, 21:29:31] Yi Hein: Haha like they are not even hiding that they are rigging the selection
  [2/3/17, 21:30:25] Yi Hein: My house captain literally said to one guy that he's going to help one of the applicants get in. And that is before the selection test even started
  [2/3/17, 21:30:50] Yi Hein: But he said he was impartial for the selection test so I though he'll be fair
  [2/3/17, 21:31:00] Yi Hein: But turns out the guy and the girl got in
  [2/3/17, 21:32:13] Yi Hein: I'm curious how do you always remain so optimistic haha
  [2/3/17, 21:34:22] Shannon: OMG that's Super corrupted and just bad and despicable
  [2/3/17, 21:34:31] Shannon: I don't even know what to say
  [2/3/17, 21:35:37] Shannon: Sigh are you sad over it? I'd be really upset
  [2/3/17, 21:36:05] Shannon: HAHA I'm really not an optimistic person nicole always says I'm a pessimistic person when it comes to myself
  [2/3/17, 21:38:30] Yi Hein: I've kind of got over it. I've got to accept it I Guess. I've heard council selection is more rigged so good to have mental preparation haha
  [2/3/17, 21:39:32] Shannon: Ohh
  [2/3/17, 21:39:35] Shannon: Wow...
  [2/3/17, 21:39:45] Shannon: I really hope you get it and change this messed up system
  [2/3/17, 21:40:24] Yi Hein: Yeah I hope so, but that if I can somehow get into the system though
  [2/3/17, 21:42:05] Yi Hein: Yeah but that's cause you always think about yourself last, you're  optimistic about others though
  [2/3/17, 21:43:03] Yi Hein: That's actually an admirable trait but you should also have more trust in yourself too
  [2/3/17, 21:43:53] Shannon: Idkekkdkfn idk haha I'm currently having a random self loathing moment now
  [2/3/17, 21:44:08] Shannon: It's like this self absorbed thing that happens to me once in a while HAHA
  [2/3/17, 21:44:35] Shannon: Sorry haha idk I have a lot of self pity you can just ignore me
  [2/3/17, 21:49:23] Yi Hein: Why would you even hate yourself 😔, if I were as nice as you I'll love myself
  [2/3/17, 21:50:49] Yi Hein: And even though you think you become self-absorbed for a while, you are still not as self-absorbed compared to many people in the society
  [2/3/17, 21:56:34] Shannon: Idk
  [2/3/17, 21:56:38] Shannon: I'm quite messed up
  [2/3/17, 21:57:11] Yi Hein: Well haha I don't mind you telling me how messed up it is
  [2/3/17, 21:57:23] Yi Hein: I don't judge
  [2/3/17, 21:57:27] Shannon: HAHHAA it's Super like
  [2/3/17, 21:57:28] Shannon: Bad
  [2/3/17, 21:57:29] Shannon: Idk
  [2/3/17, 21:57:37] Yi Hein: I won't judge like honestly
  [2/3/17, 21:57:37] Shannon: You'll probably find me Super weird afterwards
  [2/3/17, 21:57:58] Yi Hein: You probably think I've very high expectations of you
  [2/3/17, 21:58:17] Yi Hein: But I don't judge, I'm weird too
  [2/3/17, 21:58:31] Shannon: I have like Super Low self esteem haha
  [2/3/17, 21:58:31] Shannon: Like seriously Low
  [2/3/17, 21:58:55] Shannon: And I get emo very easily I'm Super sensitive
  [2/3/17, 21:59:24] Shannon: I've lost a lot of friendships cos of that haha bc I keep thinking I'm a burden
  [2/3/17, 21:59:31] Shannon: Idk I thought it got better but I Guess it didn't
  [2/3/17, 21:59:44] Shannon: I think school mag made it worse haha it really made me feel like crap
  [2/3/17, 21:59:51] Shannon: I have social anxiety too
  [2/3/17, 22:00:13] Yi Hein: Wait I'm still waiting for the messed up part
  [2/3/17, 22:00:19] Shannon: I freak out when I'm around strangers and stuff
  [2/3/17, 22:00:20] Shannon: HAHAHA
  [2/3/17, 22:00:27] Shannon: Isn't that whole thing q messed up
  [2/3/17, 22:00:28] Shannon: Idkdkdkdkjdof
  [2/3/17, 22:00:40] Shannon: Like my whole mental health is messed up
  [2/3/17, 22:00:42] Shannon: Idk man
  [2/3/17, 22:01:17] Yi Hein: Well I wouldn't call it messed up just Low-self esteem
  [2/3/17, 22:01:49] Yi Hein: I was probably way worse than you last time. Especially in primary school
  [2/3/17, 22:02:14] Yi Hein: It takes time to build it up
  [2/3/17, 22:03:22] Shannon: Haha idk what to say
  [2/3/17, 22:03:23] Shannon: Sorry
  [2/3/17, 22:03:26] Yi Hein: Haha I'm quite sensitive too but it got better
  [2/3/17, 22:03:39] Shannon: Don't worry I'm not usually like this ok!!
  [2/3/17, 22:03:43] Shannon: It's very random
  [2/3/17, 22:04:11] Shannon: HAHA you should just forget everything
  [2/3/17, 22:04:19] Yi Hein: I'm not judging haha, if not you seem much more relatable
  [2/3/17, 22:04:36] Yi Hein: I was probably much more messed up haha
  [2/3/17, 22:05:32] Yi Hein: Your messed up isn't as bad as mine....
  [2/3/17, 22:05:52] Shannon: Idk I don't really wanna talk about it haha
  [2/3/17, 22:06:18] Yi Hein: Don't tell anyone but I've actually tried killing myself quite a few times haha, but didn't have the guts
  [2/3/17, 22:06:24] Yi Hein: Oh well
  [2/3/17, 22:06:39] Yi Hein: Well it's good to face it
  [2/3/17, 22:06:46] Shannon: :/
  [2/3/17, 22:06:50] Shannon: Hope you're better now
  [2/3/17, 22:06:54] Yi Hein: That's how you build your self-esteem up though
  [2/3/17, 22:07:07] Shannon: I'm v cowardly so I always run away from problems
  [2/3/17, 22:07:11] Shannon: This is very depressing
  [2/3/17, 22:07:23] Shannon: Please don't hate yourself you're a nice person
  [2/3/17, 22:07:30] Yi Hein: Well then the next time you feel like running away, I'll make you stay
  [2/3/17, 22:07:34] Yi Hein: Break the cycle
  [2/3/17, 22:08:34] Yi Hein: I mean nothing will change if you don't do anything
  [2/3/17, 22:10:05] Yi Hein: And for the School Mag thing, that's not even running away, that 's staying away from weird people, a logical choice in my opinion
  [2/3/17, 22:14:11] Yi Hein: Well if you really don't want to be cowardly, don't run away from the problem of being cowardly
  [2/3/17, 22:14:35] Shannon: Thanks
  [2/3/17, 22:14:36] Shannon: Haha
  [2/3/17, 22:14:50] Shannon: Sorry i feel quite crap now I don't really know what to say
  [2/3/17, 22:15:09] Yi Hein: Why?
  [2/3/17, 22:15:38] Shannon: Idk haha I Guess it's just cos I suck at a lot of stuff
  [2/3/17, 22:15:56] Yi Hein: Such as what?
  [2/3/17, 22:16:05] Yi Hein: It's okay to share
  [2/3/17, 22:16:15] Shannon: Like
  [2/3/17, 22:16:17] Shannon: Everything
  [2/3/17, 22:16:25] Shannon: Except acads
  [2/3/17, 22:16:32] Shannon: Which is Super pathetic
  [2/3/17, 22:17:24] Yi Hein: You got to be more specific, you can start with what's bothering you most
  [2/3/17, 22:17:42] Shannon: Haha are you annoyed
  [2/3/17, 22:17:43] Shannon: I'm sorry
  [2/3/17, 22:17:50] Yi Hein: No haha
  [2/3/17, 22:17:58] Yi Hein: Not at all
  [2/3/17, 22:18:00] Shannon: Honestly idek
  [2/3/17, 22:18:12] Shannon: I think it's mostly stemming from school mag and being afraid of being left out
  [2/3/17, 22:18:13] Shannon: In class
  [2/3/17, 22:18:31] Shannon: I'm half obsessed with cliques forming and today was the first time I sat with the class for recess
  [2/3/17, 22:18:48] Shannon: And it was so awkward i didn't know what to do
  [2/3/17, 22:19:06] Shannon: And like during SCH mag I'm such a burden I can't help at all
  [2/3/17, 22:19:13] Shannon: And like one of the guys told me my photos suck ha ha ha
  [2/3/17, 22:19:21] Shannon: Ok he told my Friend who told me but still
  [2/3/17, 22:20:07] Yi Hein: Well I feel like you fit really well in class, you can ask other people too. Like honestly, you are thinking too much
  [2/3/17, 22:20:18] Shannon: Haha
  [2/3/17, 22:20:22] Shannon: Nicole says that all the time
  [2/3/17, 22:20:30] Yi Hein: Like 9 people voted you to be welfare rep for a reason
  [2/3/17, 22:21:16] Yi Hein: I'll help you ask the others secretly/ discreetly. I'm sure they share the same opinion as me
  [2/3/17, 22:21:23] Shannon: HAHAHA it's fine
  [2/3/17, 22:21:28] Shannon: It's probably all in my head
  [2/3/17, 22:22:12] Shannon: It's like so ironic I know everything is probably just me over thinking but I still feel very jsiekdkfkekdk
  [2/3/17, 22:22:40] Yi Hein: And well it's pretty mean for him to say your photos suck. But since he said that, you should try to improve your skills. I'm sure there quite a few people in our class who's not bad at photog
  [2/3/17, 22:22:56] Yi Hein: I know a few friends who are really good too
  [2/3/17, 22:23:01] Shannon: Ikr
  [2/3/17, 22:23:04] Yi Hein: Maybe they can help you
  [2/3/17, 22:23:06] Shannon: Idk
  [2/3/17, 22:23:11] Shannon: Idek why I'm sad HAHA
  [2/3/17, 22:23:33] Shannon: I Guess if I'm happy most of the time then the sadness will just come randomly all at one shot
  [2/3/17, 22:23:49] Shannon: I think I'm gonna quit school mag I feel like I'm gonna be more stressed if I stay
  [2/3/17, 22:24:25] Yi Hein: I mean you overthinking is probably stemming from your Low-self esteem so maybe you can start by slowing building that up
  [2/3/17, 22:25:18] Yi Hein: Try not to hide too sad things to yourself, like it's okay to share with others
  [2/3/17, 22:27:47] Yi Hein: Wanna talk in school tomorrow? I'm open to anything
  [2/3/17, 22:28:32] Shannon: TBH not really
  [2/3/17, 22:28:38] Shannon: I don't like talking about it
  [2/3/17, 22:29:10] Shannon: It's like acknowledging it exists which makes it harder to pretend it doesn't exist hahaha
  [2/3/17, 22:29:47] Shannon: Just pretend you don't know okay HAHA I wouldn't know what to say if you talk to me about it
  [2/3/17, 22:29:49] Yi Hein: Well pretending it doesn't exist is not the way to go
  [2/3/17, 22:30:06] Yi Hein: Of all the times I've pretended I'm not sad, nothing has changed
  [2/3/17, 22:30:13] Shannon: Idk I believe in
  [2/3/17, 22:30:16] Shannon: Mind over matter
  [2/3/17, 22:30:22] Shannon: If I keep telling myself it's okay I will be okay
  [2/3/17, 22:30:51] Yi Hein: Things change when you start facing it, resolve the root cause and not calm the symptoms
  [2/3/17, 22:30:56] Yi Hein: I know it takes a Long time
  [2/3/17, 22:32:05] Shannon: Idk how to improve my self esteem though haha
  [2/3/17, 22:32:10] Yi Hein: But feel free to talk to me when you feel ready, or even if your don't feel like you're ready to acknowledge it
  [2/3/17, 22:32:13] Shannon: It's way better than last year alr though
  [2/3/17, 22:32:17] Shannon: It was Super bad last year
  [2/3/17, 22:32:39] Yi Hein: I fell like more about confidence
  [2/3/17, 22:32:39] Shannon: Actually it was the worst in Sec 2 HAHA I would randomly break down in school which sucked a lot
  [2/3/17, 22:33:18] Shannon: Thanks though for listening to me even though I don't think I made much sense
  [2/3/17, 22:33:21] Shannon: I feel better hahaha
  [2/3/17, 22:33:54] Yi Hein: Haha this probably sound Super un-manly but when I was in Sec 3 cried until my pillows were drenched
  [2/3/17, 22:36:05] Yi Hein: Well I started my thinking about myself more, which sounds really self-Centred. But I realised that always trying to be selfless actually causes more harm than good to the people around me
  [2/3/17, 22:42:50] Shannon: HAHA I think about myself a lot though
  [2/3/17, 22:42:54] Shannon: I don't think I'm very selfless
  [2/3/17, 22:42:58] Shannon: Ah well
  [2/3/17, 22:43:02] Shannon: I feel much better now
  [2/3/17, 22:43:14] Shannon: It's fine haha
  [2/3/17, 22:43:24] Shannon: Thanks though
  [2/3/17, 22:43:26] Shannon: For everything haha
  [2/3/17, 22:48:10] Yi Hein: Yeah feel free to talk to me when you feel like it
  [2/3/17, 22:48:36] Yi Hein: Btw, this seems pretty selfless to me
  [2/3/17, 22:49:12] Shannon: No it's Super annoying
  [2/3/17, 22:49:14] Shannon: For
  [2/3/17, 22:49:16] Shannon: The other person
  [2/3/17, 22:49:20] Shannon: It's very tiring to be friends with me
  [2/3/17, 22:49:25] Shannon: As in close friends HAHA
  [2/3/17, 22:49:39] Shannon: cos I need a lot of affirmation or I'll get all emo and stuff
  [2/3/17, 22:49:58] Shannon: It's Super pathetic
  [2/3/17, 22:50:26] Shannon: Then if I feel like I'm Super burden I'll just distance myself from the person until idk we don't even talk anymore
  [2/3/17, 22:50:29] Yi Hein: Well everyone needs affirmation, oh yeah I forgot it's also that I started improving my Low-self esteem
  [2/3/17, 22:50:34] Shannon: That's why I avoid a lot of people in our level HAHAH
  [2/3/17, 22:50:49] Yi Hein: But why would you what to distance yourself?
  [2/3/17, 22:51:03] Shannon: Cos I feel like I'm too much of a burden to the people
  [2/3/17, 22:51:07] Shannon: It's way too tiring for them
  [2/3/17, 22:51:23] Yi Hein: Exactly, you're thinking about how others feel first
  [2/3/17, 22:51:34] Yi Hein: It's kind of a vicious cycle if you think about it
  [2/3/17, 22:51:38] Shannon: Yeah
  [2/3/17, 22:52:16] Yi Hein: So perhaps you can try to stop thinking you're a burden cause other people can be even more burden too
  [2/3/17, 22:52:31] Shannon: I haven't really met any burden friends though
  [2/3/17, 22:52:44] Shannon: HAHA anyway when people rely on me I feel less useless
  [2/3/17, 22:52:59] Shannon: Which is pretty selfish
  [2/3/17, 22:52:59] Shannon: TBH
  [2/3/17, 22:53:08] Shannon: Now that I think of it it's Super self centered
  [2/3/17, 22:53:41] Yi Hein: Well if you think that to make yourself less selfish, you'll not let others rely on you isn't that worse ?
  [2/3/17, 22:53:57] Yi Hein: Think of feeling less useless a by-product
  [2/3/17, 22:54:11] Shannon: HAHA by product
  [2/3/17, 22:54:13] Shannon: Science student
  [2/3/17, 22:54:17] Yi Hein: Hahaha
  [2/3/17, 22:54:36] Shannon: Nah I just feel like I shouldn't feel that people relying on me is good
  [2/3/17, 22:54:37] Shannon: Because
  [2/3/17, 22:54:46] Shannon: If they need to rely on someone in the first place
  [2/3/17, 22:54:55] Shannon: It means that they're in a bad position
  [2/3/17, 22:54:57] Shannon: Which is sad
  [2/3/17, 22:55:01] Shannon: So I shouldn't feel good
  [2/3/17, 22:55:25] Yi Hein: Why though?
  [2/3/17, 22:55:49] Shannon: Why would you need to rely on someone if you're perfectly happy
  [2/3/17, 22:55:54] Yi Hein: Everyone relies on one another
  [2/3/17, 22:56:33] Yi Hein: Like I've accomplished nothing by myself
  [2/3/17, 22:56:43] Yi Hein: And I think that goes for everyone
  [2/3/17, 22:56:53] Shannon: Oh
  [2/3/17, 22:56:55] Shannon: Yeah
  [2/3/17, 22:56:56] Shannon: True
  [2/3/17, 22:58:04] Yi Hein: People rely on you because they need you to help them. Just like you'll need others to help you too
  [2/3/17, 22:58:41] Yi Hein: It goes two ways I guess
  [2/3/17, 23:00:37] Shannon: Yeah
  [2/3/17, 23:00:50] Shannon: I'm gonna sleep now haha
  [2/3/17, 23:00:51] Shannon: Good night
  [2/3/17, 23:00:57] Yi Hein: Yeah good night
  [2/3/17, 23:01:03] Shannon: Thanks for listening HAHA even though it was v weird and prob made little sense
  [2/3/17, 23:02:22] Shannon: I hope I won't become a burden to you one day HAHAH and I hope you don't think I'm like weird and emo and stuff idk
  [2/3/17, 23:04:55] Yi Hein: HAHAHA, feel free to be a burden, cause I'm going to be a burden too 😂
  [4/3/17, 18:32:05] Yi Hein: Hey Shannon you did your bio lab report yet?
  [4/3/17, 19:21:29] Shannon: Nope I spent the whole day doing chem HAHA
  [4/3/17, 19:21:39] Shannon: I'm really worried I will fail chem or at least do badly
  [4/3/17, 19:21:52] Shannon: I'm gonna do the bio thing once I reach home (it's due on Monday right)
  [4/3/17, 19:22:07] Yi Hein: Yup
  [4/3/17, 19:22:38] Yi Hein: Come on you're not that bad, you did well for chem in MG right?
  [4/3/17, 19:22:43] Shannon: Btw for the Chinese WA practice must we write the whole thing or just the intro
  [4/3/17, 19:22:58] Yi Hein: The whole thing
  [4/3/17, 19:23:05] Shannon: Ohh okay thanks
  [4/3/17, 19:23:11] Shannon: Uhh chem was my worst science haha
  [4/3/17, 19:23:25] Shannon: I barely got a 7, and I think a lot of people got like mid 80s or higher
  [3/4/17, 22:28:09] Yi Hein: Hey Shannon you've done your Chem Lab Report right?
  [3/4/17, 22:28:24] Shannon: Yeah
  ‎[3/4/17, 22:28:31] Shannon: ‎image omitted
  [3/4/17, 22:28:33] Shannon: ^ Hao Chen sigh
  [3/4/17, 22:28:44] Shannon: How is tim my Boyfriend what even
  [3/4/17, 22:29:05] Yi Hein: Hahaha
  [3/4/17, 22:29:19] Shannon: Do you need help w chem?
  [3/4/17, 22:29:31] Shannon: Do people actually think tim and I have something on btw
  [3/4/17, 22:29:32] Yi Hein: I think there's a crush polygon spreading around
  [3/4/17, 22:29:50] Shannon: What's a crush polygon HAHAHAHA like an extended version of love triangle?
  ‎[3/4/17, 22:29:56] Yi Hein: ‎image omitted
  [3/4/17, 22:30:10] Yi Hein: Haha yeah something like that
  [3/4/17, 22:30:37] Yi Hein: My CaCO3 mass is more than mass of egg she'll
  [3/4/17, 22:30:44] Shannon: HAHA oh can you share it with me
  [3/4/17, 22:30:52] Shannon: Oh yeah Gideon and I had that problem
  [3/4/17, 22:31:07] Yi Hein: I asked Jordan and he said his was fine
  [3/4/17, 22:31:18] Shannon: Did you forget to include the 250 cm3 in ur calculations
  [3/4/17, 22:31:20] Yi Hein: And his volume of NaOH used as about the same as me
  [3/4/17, 22:31:30] Yi Hein: Wait a minute
  [3/4/17, 22:32:23] Yi Hein: OMG no wonder
  [3/4/17, 22:32:28] Shannon: YA IKR haha
  [3/4/17, 22:32:35] Shannon: Gideon and I were like omggggg
  [3/4/17, 22:32:40] Shannon: When we figured it out
  [3/4/17, 22:33:46] Yi Hein: I think it's Darren> Shannon> Tim + Sian> Elliot + Joe<>Nahian
  [3/4/17, 22:33:55] Yi Hein: HAHAHA act like you don't know about it
  [3/4/17, 22:34:05] Shannon: WHAT
  [3/4/17, 22:34:06] Shannon: HAHAHAHAHHAA
  [3/4/17, 22:34:10] Shannon: HAHAHAHA
  [3/4/17, 22:34:17] Shannon: So darren likes me but I like tim?
  [3/4/17, 22:34:22] Shannon: How did people even get that
  [3/4/17, 22:34:34] Shannon: And Tim and Sian like Elliot?
  [3/4/17, 22:34:48] Yi Hein: This is actually quite interesting to hear from two perspectives
  [3/4/17, 22:35:03] Shannon: What two perspectives
  [3/4/17, 22:35:08] Shannon: EXPLAIN YOURSELF YI HEINNNNN
  [3/4/17, 22:35:14] Yi Hein: Hahahahaha
  [3/4/17, 22:35:21] Yi Hein: Don't kill me
  [3/4/17, 22:35:24] Shannon: DONT YOU DARE GO OFFLINE NOW HAHAHA
  [3/4/17, 22:35:28] Shannon: I won't
  [3/4/17, 22:35:54] Yi Hein: Lmao jk
  [3/4/17, 22:36:00] Yi Hein: Ok so
  [3/4/17, 22:37:04] Yi Hein: Apparently you wanted to Sian to switch seats with Tim so that you can sit with him (and there's probably another reason which I'm not told)
  [3/4/17, 22:37:23] Shannon: HAHAHAHA
  [3/4/17, 22:37:24] Shannon: OMG
  [3/4/17, 22:37:25] Shannon: WHAT
  [3/4/17, 22:37:28] Yi Hein: And Darren keeps wanting to talk to you so yeah
  [3/4/17, 22:37:31] Shannon: I DIDNT WAIT SIAN TO SWITXH
  [3/4/17, 22:37:37] Shannon: SHE KEPT ASKING ME TO SWITCH
  [3/4/17, 22:38:05] Yi Hein: OMG Shannon calm down
  [3/4/17, 22:38:08] Shannon: Like since end of t1, she kept telling me she wanted to switch seats bc she couldn't see
  [3/4/17, 22:38:19] Shannon: And I happened to know that tim wanted to change seats too
  [3/4/17, 22:38:29] Shannon: So I was like, ok why don't you two change
  [3/4/17, 22:38:57] Shannon: GROSS who came up with this
  I won't dislike the person don't worry I just want to know who stirred this thing up
  [3/4/17, 22:39:01] Shannon: Was it Joe/ Nahian
  [3/4/17, 22:39:05] Shannon: Or like Isaiah
  [3/4/17, 22:39:06] Yi Hein: OOooh I see
  [3/4/17, 22:39:23] Shannon: I know Isaiah thought that tim and I had smth on idk why tho
  [3/4/17, 22:39:54] Yi Hein: I think people kinda just inferred from what they saw
  [3/4/17, 22:40:15] Shannon: HAHA but tim and I don't even talk
  [3/4/17, 22:40:30] Shannon: How many people think this though
  [3/4/17, 22:40:44] Shannon: But tim and Sian both like Elliot?
  [3/4/17, 22:40:51] Yi Hein: I don't know actually
  [3/4/17, 22:40:57] Yi Hein: WAIT WHAT
  [3/4/17, 22:41:00] Shannon: I don't think tim is fat
  [3/4/17, 22:41:03] Shannon: *gay
  [3/4/17, 22:41:05] Shannon: HAHAHAHA
  [3/4/17, 22:41:07] Shannon: YOUR ARROWS
  [3/4/17, 22:41:10] Shannon: AND YOUR +
  [3/4/17, 22:41:14] Yi Hein: Oh no it's not that
  [3/4/17, 22:41:40] Shannon: And Joe and Nahian are together?
  [3/4/17, 22:41:41] Shannon: HAHAHA
  [3/4/17, 22:41:50] Yi Hein: + represents a different system, it's a summation of the crush equations
  [3/4/17, 22:41:50] Shannon: Who did you hear it from tho
  [3/4/17, 22:41:54] Shannon: I see
  [3/4/17, 22:42:02] Shannon: Sigma notation
  [3/4/17, 22:42:16] Shannon: Why must I be involved
  [3/4/17, 22:42:20] Yi Hein: There was some joke about them being gay, it's just for laughs haha
  [3/4/17, 22:42:23] Shannon: I bet it was JY
  [3/4/17, 22:42:27] Shannon: He's so loud
  [3/4/17, 22:42:38] Yi Hein: Definitely not
  [3/4/17, 22:42:37] Shannon: And he keep saying that Tim GCPed for me which is so not true
  [3/4/17, 22:42:45] Yi Hein: Wait really
  [3/4/17, 22:43:04] Yi Hein: I didn't even know JY knew about it
  [3/4/17, 22:43:14] Shannon: Yeah cos tim and I are pretty close friends actually HAHA but I don't think people know that
  [3/4/17, 22:43:23] Shannon: Oh
  [3/4/17, 22:43:27] Shannon: So it's the back row?
  [3/4/17, 22:43:35] Shannon: 😾
  [3/4/17, 22:43:38] Shannon: HAHAHA
  [3/4/17, 22:43:41] Shannon: Thanks for telling me though
  [3/4/17, 22:43:48] Yi Hein: Hahahaha don't kill them please
  [3/4/17, 22:43:51] Shannon: Hao chen said he heard it from many people
  [3/4/17, 22:43:58] Shannon: I won't HAHA
  [3/4/17, 22:44:00] Yi Hein: Yeah it's complicated
  [3/4/17, 22:44:05] Shannon: I just want to know why they think that way
  [3/4/17, 22:44:07] Shannon: Like I don't get it
  [3/4/17, 22:44:16] Shannon: I thought v few people knew that tim and I were close friends
  [3/4/17, 22:44:58] Yi Hein: Yeah indeed
  [3/4/17, 22:45:07] Yi Hein: That's probably why they inferred wrongly
  [3/4/17, 22:45:24] Shannon: But the only thing is the Seat switching thing?
  [3/4/17, 22:45:29] Shannon: That's so unreliable
  [3/4/17, 22:45:46] Shannon: Or was it Benedict HAHAHAH
  [3/4/17, 22:45:48] Yi Hein: That what I heard, I'm sure there's much more that I'm not aware of
  [3/4/17, 22:45:56] Shannon: He saw us studying together before
  [3/4/17, 22:46:03] Shannon: But that was only once
  [3/4/17, 22:46:09] Shannon: Sighhhhhhhhhhhh
  [3/4/17, 22:46:16] Shannon: Why all this gossipppppp
  [3/4/17, 22:46:31] Shannon: Please tell me if you hear anything else HAHAHAH
  [3/4/17, 22:46:44] Yi Hein: Cause some people have been in a Boy's school for 10 years
  [3/4/17, 22:47:17] Yi Hein: So they think everything has to do with a relationship
  [3/4/17, 22:47:18] Shannon: No one thinks that tim likes me back right
  [3/4/17, 22:47:26] Shannon: I Guess that's good for him at least HAHAHA
  [3/4/17, 22:47:37] Shannon: Yucks it's so not true
  [3/4/17, 22:48:06] Yi Hein: But btw
  [3/4/17, 22:48:26] Yi Hein: I need your advice now
  [3/4/17, 22:48:31] Shannon: Oh
  [3/4/17, 22:48:34] Shannon: What happened
  [3/4/17, 22:49:04] Yi Hein: I've been pretty stupid today 😔
  [3/4/17, 22:49:26] Shannon: Why :(
  [3/4/17, 22:51:37] Yi Hein: Ok so, l was climbing up the stairs when a my SC situational group mate said like "Hi" and was smiling (according to my friend). And like I wasn't paying attention so I accidentally ignored her, apparently she didn't look happy after that
  [3/4/17, 22:51:53] Yi Hein: I think I did it to another person too
  [3/4/17, 22:51:59] Shannon: Ohh
  [3/4/17, 22:52:05] Shannon: Don't worry too much about it!!
  [3/4/17, 22:52:11] Yi Hein: Gosh it's so cringy
  [3/4/17, 22:52:24] Shannon: If you see her next time just say hey (name)
  [3/4/17, 22:52:31] Shannon: Make sure you include the name, it's more personal
  [3/4/17, 22:52:39] Shannon: And smile
  [3/4/17, 22:52:40] Yi Hein: Hahaha okie
  [3/4/17, 22:52:47] Shannon: So that she'll know that you're not ignoring her or smth
  [3/4/17, 22:52:57] Shannon: It's a totally honest mistake you don't have to feel bad about it!!
  [3/4/17, 22:53:24] Shannon: I'm sure you'll get a chance to write the wrong
  [3/4/17, 22:53:26] Shannon: *eight
  [3/4/17, 22:53:28] Shannon: *right
  [3/4/17, 22:53:31] Shannon: :)
  [3/4/17, 22:53:40] Yi Hein: Yup thanks haha
  [3/4/17, 22:54:06] Yi Hein: Btw gotta weird question to ask
  [3/4/17, 22:54:21] Shannon: HAHA ok
  [3/4/17, 22:54:32] Yi Hein: Be honest ok
  [3/4/17, 22:54:31] Shannon: I'm guessing it's not chem
  [3/4/17, 22:54:35] Shannon: Okay
  [3/4/17, 22:54:40] Shannon: This is scary
  [3/4/17, 22:54:48] Shannon: I hope it's not a hard question
  [3/4/17, 22:54:59] Yi Hein: Were you pissed off at me at some point?
  [3/4/17, 22:55:07] Shannon: HAHAHA no
  [3/4/17, 22:55:21] Shannon: I don't get pi**ed off at people easily
  [3/4/17, 22:55:33] Yi Hein: Or just annoyed?
  [3/4/17, 22:55:33] Shannon: Like I haven't been really angry this year yet, just mildly annoyed
  [3/4/17, 22:55:40] Shannon: Not at you though
  [3/4/17, 22:55:51] Shannon: At Isaiah yes
  [3/4/17, 22:56:00] Shannon: But not you HAHA cos you didn't cross any lines
  [3/4/17, 22:56:17] Shannon: Likes when you were teasing me about the darren thing you didn't go too far so it's okay
  [3/4/17, 22:56:20] Shannon: Isaiah did though
  [3/4/17, 22:57:09] Yi Hein: Just curious what are the things you can't stand ( "lines" )
  [3/4/17, 22:57:15] Shannon: HAHA
  [3/4/17, 22:57:24] Shannon: Like mentioning awkward moments
  [3/4/17, 22:57:31] Shannon: Like there peanut *cough* butter
  [3/4/17, 22:57:34] Shannon: *the
  [3/4/17, 22:57:58] Shannon: Esp when I'm actually really bothered by it
  [3/4/17, 22:58:09] Shannon: Cos I was really ugh about the darren thing (though I think it's ok now)
  [3/4/17, 22:58:41] Yi Hein: Ah ok I see
  [3/4/17, 22:59:03] Shannon: Thanks for asking though
  [3/4/17, 22:59:06] Shannon: You're really nice HAHAH
  [3/4/17, 22:59:27] Yi Hein: No haha you don't know the real me
  [3/4/17, 23:00:01] Shannon: HAHA I'm sure everyone has their own bad parts and good parts
  [3/4/17, 23:00:54] Shannon: But like Sirius black once said, "the world isn't split into good people and death eaters. We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are."
  [3/4/17, 23:01:31] Shannon: So even if you're not that good 99% of the time, and you're nice and good 1% of the time (which is def true bc I've seen your nice part), you're alr a good person!
  [3/4/17, 23:03:00] Yi Hein: So philosophical haha 🤔
  [17/5/17, 22:15:18] Yi Hein: Hey Shannon can you bring the calculator you mentioned to class tmr?
  [19/5/17, 22:11:02] Yi Hein: Btw, you can consult Hao Chen for $5 MCs
  [19/5/17, 22:11:12] Shannon: HAHAHA What are $5 MCs
  [19/5/17, 22:11:18] Shannon: No I legit don't feel well haha
  [19/5/17, 22:11:56] Yi Hein: Oh
  [19/5/17, 22:13:26] Yi Hein: Probably too little sleep hahaha gws
  [20/5/17, 09:21:58] Shannon: Tsk I can't believe you thought that I was gonna skip bc of a not legit excuse
  [20/5/17, 09:22:14] Shannon: I slept for more than half the amount of time I've slept in the whole week last night
  [20/5/17, 09:22:18] Shannon: So scary
  [20/5/17, 11:11:45] Yi Hein: HAHAHA normally asking whether you need MC implies ponning
  [20/5/17, 11:12:59] Yi Hein: I Guess I kinda thought that coz my classmates kept ponning last year
  [20/5/17, 11:13:13] Shannon: Pfft
  [20/5/17, 11:13:25] Shannon: Do we need to sit with our classes
  [20/5/17, 11:13:26] Shannon: OH YA
  [20/5/17, 11:13:31] Shannon: What bio worksheets are due on monday
  [20/5/17, 11:13:33] Yi Hein: 👍🏼👏🏼
  [20/5/17, 11:13:58] Yi Hein: Not very sure
  [20/5/17, 11:14:29] Yi Hein: You're coming today?
  [20/5/17, 11:14:56] Yi Hein: Yeah we need to sit with our classes
  [2/8/17, 19:13:28] Shannon: Hey yi Hein!!!!!
  [2/8/17, 23:58:51] Shannon: Are you still awake :((
  [3/8/17, 05:11:42] Yi Hein: Sorry I crashed, what happened?
  [3/8/17, 19:26:56] Shannon: Hey yi Hein, could you help me ask if any of the councillors will be willing to come down from 9-1pm on sat to help us usher for SYPC? CAS hours will be given :)) we need 2!!
  [3/8/17, 19:27:05] Shannon: Or one is fine too actually
  [3/8/17, 19:29:19] Yi Hein: I believe they've already asked yesterday, not sure who signed up though?
  [3/8/17, 19:32:25] Yi Hein: Where's it btw?
  [3/8/17, 19:32:46] Shannon: Oh okay
  [3/8/17, 19:32:51] Shannon: Thanks!
  [3/8/17, 19:32:55] Shannon: School!
  [3/8/17, 19:32:57] Shannon: CPA1
  [3/8/17, 19:33:37] Shannon: And like we need SJAB person/ first aider too haha for the whole day so it'll be nice if the person could do first aid ( can claim more hours )
  But like if cannot then it's fine
  [3/8/17, 19:33:40] Shannon: Thanks so much haha
  [3/8/17, 20:18:54] Yi Hein: Can double up as a first aider? Sounds pretty tempting lmao
  [3/8/17, 20:20:29] Shannon: Yes yi Hein!!!!
  [3/8/17, 20:20:35] Shannon: You are like totally the best person for the job haha
  [3/8/17, 20:20:46] Shannon: That's also what I wanted to ask haha
  ‎[3/8/17, 20:59:46] Yi Hein: ‎image omitted
  [3/8/17, 20:59:58] Yi Hein: But yeah I can go for it
  [3/8/17, 21:00:09] Shannon: HAHAHAH what
  [3/8/17, 21:00:11] Shannon: I didn't say that
  [3/8/17, 21:00:20] Shannon: I said isaiah lived nearby
  [3/8/17, 21:00:26] Shannon: And he can be the first aid person
  [3/8/17, 21:00:29] Shannon: But he rejected me HAHA
  [3/8/17, 21:00:50] Yi Hein: So is it from 1130 or 9?
  [3/8/17, 22:22:06] Shannon: 9!
  [3/8/17, 22:22:09] Shannon: 9-1 :)
  [3/8/17, 22:22:12] Shannon: Are you okay with it!!
  [4/8/17, 21:03:36] Yi Hein: Can you update me on the timeline of events and procedure for tmr?
  [4/8/17, 21:03:44] Shannon: Yep okay! Give me a moment
  [4/8/17, 21:03:47] Shannon: 10 min ahha
  [4/8/17, 21:03:49] Shannon: I just got home
  [4/8/17, 22:07:33] Shannon: Hi yi Hein sorry the 10 min became 1h haha
  [4/8/17, 22:12:27] Shannon: Anyway this is what you should take note of:
  - you can report after your training! Just text me when you arrive and I'll come meet you
  - GOH will come at about 12.15pm, so get into your blazer and stuff by 12pm! He will be at the new boardroom so you'll walk him to CPA 1 and guide him around
  - I'll do a run through with you tmr morn as well when you arrive ok!
  [4/8/17, 22:12:34] Shannon: Everything should end by 1pm
  [4/8/17, 22:37:37] Yi Hein: Alright thanks
  [16/8/17, 20:44:50] Shannon: Hello yi hein
  [16/8/17, 21:24:09] Shannon: Does he hate me
  [16/8/17, 21:24:17] Shannon: I suppose he does right
  [16/8/17, 21:36:01] Yi Hein: dhc?
  [16/8/17, 21:36:55] Shannon: Yeah
  [16/8/17, 21:37:06] Shannon: He told you what happened right
  [16/8/17, 21:42:55] Yi Hein: kinda quite briefly though
  [16/8/17, 21:44:28] Yi Hein: i don't think hate would be the right word?
  [16/8/17, 21:44:39] Shannon: He's hurt?
  [16/8/17, 21:44:46] Shannon: He thinks I betrayed him right
  [16/8/17, 21:44:49] Shannon: And was a bad Friend
  [16/8/17, 21:45:07] Yi Hein: yup
  [16/8/17, 21:45:33] Shannon: Okay
  [16/8/17, 21:45:45] Shannon: It's alright
  [16/8/17, 21:45:46] Shannon: I
  [16/8/17, 21:45:48] Shannon: I deserve it
  [16/8/17, 21:47:15] Yi Hein: what did he say that really made you feel super uncomfortable?
  [16/8/17, 21:47:38] Shannon: I never wanted this
  [16/8/17, 21:47:41] Shannon: I
  [16/8/17, 21:47:46] Shannon: Don't know anymore
  [16/8/17, 21:47:49] Shannon: Maybe nothing happened
  [16/8/17, 21:47:54] Shannon: Maybe I imagined the past four months
  [16/8/17, 21:48:02] Shannon: I probably overreacted or something
  [16/8/17, 21:48:18] Shannon: He probably did nothing wrong
  [16/8/17, 21:48:18] Shannon: It's all my fault probably
  [16/8/17, 21:48:18] Shannon: Yes it is
  [16/8/17, 21:48:19] Shannon: I think it is
  [16/8/17, 21:48:19] Shannon: I
  [16/8/17, 21:48:19] Shannon: I
  [16/8/17, 21:48:31] Shannon: I'm sorry
  [16/8/17, 21:49:07] Yi Hein: Yeah it can feel unreal when so many things happen so fast
  [16/8/17, 21:50:15] Yi Hein: I think it's mistakes on both parts?
  [16/8/17, 21:50:28] Shannon: No it's all mine sigh
  [16/8/17, 21:50:29] Shannon: It's okay
  [16/8/17, 21:51:00] Shannon: I understand
  [16/8/17, 21:51:08] Shannon: I don't deserve his forgiveness
  [16/8/17, 21:51:16] Shannon: I don't expect him to forgive me
  [16/8/17, 21:51:43] Shannon: Nevermind it's ok!
  [16/8/17, 21:51:45] Shannon: I'm ok!
  [16/8/17, 21:58:05] Yi Hein: Tbh I think he's already gotten over it so yeah try to put all the bad things that happened in the past
  [16/8/17, 21:59:39] Yi Hein: I guess the best thing now is too look forward and see at the situation from his perspective, and he should look at the situation from your perspective
  [16/8/17, 22:00:11] Yi Hein: You never know maybe you'll be great friends with him again :)
  [16/8/17, 22:01:14] Yi Hein: Well the strongest friendships are forged through things like these
  [16/8/17, 22:01:55] Yi Hein: So yeah give yourself sometime to take it in and then move on from there
  [16/8/17, 22:04:26] Shannon: I can see it from his perspective
  [16/8/17, 22:04:28] Shannon: And it sucks
  [16/8/17, 22:04:32] Shannon: I would hate me too I guess
  [16/8/17, 22:04:35] Shannon: And so I do
  [16/8/17, 22:04:44] Shannon: And I hope it makes him happy
  [16/8/17, 22:04:49] Yi Hein: Well if he sees it from your perspective
  [16/8/17, 22:04:51] Yi Hein: It sucks
  [16/8/17, 22:04:56] Shannon: Because I can see what a terrible person I am
  [16/8/17, 22:05:02] Shannon: If he sees it from my perspective
  [16/8/17, 22:05:04] Shannon: I hope
  [16/8/17, 22:05:07] Shannon: He knows how sorry I am
  [16/8/17, 22:05:12] Shannon: And how much I do love him still
  [16/8/17, 22:05:14] Shannon: As a Friend
  [16/8/17, 22:05:21] Shannon: And that I'd do everything out of love
  [16/8/17, 22:05:36] Shannon: Does the class hate me?
  [16/8/17, 22:06:58] Yi Hein: Nah, why would they lol
  [16/8/17, 22:07:00] Yi Hein: i think everyone wants to help in anyway they can
  [16/8/17, 22:07:05] Shannon: But
  [16/8/17, 22:07:09] Shannon: Didn't he tell them what I did
  [16/8/17, 22:07:59] Yi Hein: I think Isaiah have told some ppl but very generally
  [16/8/17, 22:08:12] Yi Hein: And they understand your position
  [16/8/17, 22:09:48] Yi Hein: Tbh I think majority of the class are siding with you
  [16/8/17, 22:10:33] Yi Hein: I'm also worried is what they'll think of dhc
  [16/8/17, 22:10:41] Shannon: He
  [16/8/17, 22:10:43] Shannon: Sigh
  [16/8/17, 22:10:50] Shannon: He has the back row doesnt he
  [16/8/17, 22:10:57] Shannon: Sigh
  [16/8/17, 22:10:59] Shannon: I
  [16/8/17, 22:11:10] Shannon: Never wanted this either
  [16/8/17, 22:12:28] Yi Hein: I talked to joe and others, honestly they don't seem interested and bother to be involved
  [16/8/17, 22:13:04] Shannon: Oh that's good
  [16/8/17, 22:13:17] Yi Hein: :(
  [16/8/17, 22:14:02] Shannon: Huh why
  [16/8/17, 22:14:06] Shannon: I mean that's good right haha
  [16/8/17, 22:14:08] Shannon: Why da deface
  [16/8/17, 22:14:11] Shannon: *sad face
  [16/8/17, 22:14:14] Shannon: Like
  [16/8/17, 22:14:18] Shannon: It's better to not care
  [16/8/17, 22:14:39] Shannon: I mean it'll be better if they could give him the support he needed/ wanted but the next best thing would be to not care right
  [16/8/17, 22:15:46] Yi Hein: No it's cause the class really seems divided
  [16/8/17, 22:15:57] Shannon: Oh
  [16/8/17, 22:15:59] Shannon: Really
  [16/8/17, 22:16:01] Shannon: Like how
  [16/8/17, 22:16:06] Shannon: Sigh it's all my fault I'm so sorry
  [16/8/17, 22:17:01] Yi Hein: Nah it cause the fact that they are taking sides instead of looking at it objectively
  [16/8/17, 22:17:34] Yi Hein: I think I'll be good for you and dhc to come to a consensus and clear things up to the class
  [16/8/17, 22:18:20] Shannon: Huh didn't you just say that they don't care haha
  [16/8/17, 22:18:27] Shannon: I'm not allowed to talk to him
  [16/8/17, 22:18:37] Shannon: Or interact with him really
  [16/8/17, 22:18:54] Yi Hein: Your parents don't allow or like it's best not to?
  [16/8/17, 22:19:27] Shannon: Teachers
  [16/8/17, 22:19:38] Shannon: I didn't want to block him either
  [16/8/17, 22:19:47] Shannon: I was forced to
  [16/8/17, 22:19:53] Shannon: On all social media
  [16/8/17, 22:22:19] Yi Hein: Oh well just let things calm down first
  [16/8/17, 22:43:59] Yi Hein: As a friend, I'll advice that it would be beneficial to adhere closely to your beliefs and words truthfully in all situations

  [30/4/18, 20:42:41] Yi Hein: Typing it now
  [30/4/18, 22:00:52] Yi Hein: Volunteering and befriending the patients at KDF was no doubt an enriching experience. I felt that it was very interesting to hear about their stories and listen to the life lessons they shared. At times, I was so engrossed that before I knew it, the befriending session was over and looked forward to the next session. Seeing the patients smile and laugh while playing board games with them was also very heartwarming and fulfilling. It was at these times where I felt that I am indeed making a positive difference to the lives of others and hence strengthening my belief that what I am doing is very meaningful.
  [30/4/18, 22:01:24] Yi Hein: Sflr 😓
  [30/4/18, 22:01:46] Shannon: Thanks so muchhhh

  [29/4/19, 05:01:56] Shannon: Tried to find work HAHA but then cos of my volunteering stuff it's quite hard to do office hours (I also give tuition to kids w special needs) so in the end I'm just doing random ad hoc stuff

  [29/4/19, 05:02:44] Shannon: oh like the beneficiaries hahah

  [3/5/19, 21:14:30] Shannon: Huh really
  [3/5/19, 21:14:34] Yi Hein: If I don't get an offer, would it still work?
  [3/5/19, 21:14:35] Shannon: That’s weird!!
  [3/5/19, 21:31:25] Yi Hein: What did it say when you entered the portal!
  [3/5/19, 21:31:28] Yi Hein: *?
  [3/5/19, 21:33:28] Shannon: Not sure... but I think maybe they also haven’t fully updated everyone yet cos some ppl who didn’t apply to other unis didn’t get a reply either
  [3/5/19, 21:33:30] Shannon: Like Claudia
  ‎[3/5/19, 21:33:34] Shannon: ‎image omitted
  [3/5/19, 21:33:45] Shannon: Cos you’re only waiting for NUS right and you don’t have second choice
  [3/5/19, 21:36:51] Yi Hein: Yeah
  [3/5/19, 21:37:21] Yi Hein: I believe I can't login cos I don't have an offer
  [3/5/19, 21:38:13] Shannon: Yeah
  [3/5/19, 21:38:16] Shannon: Maybe next week then
  [3/5/19, 21:38:24] Shannon: Cos I think they’re not done updating for everyone else
  [3/5/19, 21:38:32] Shannon: Like that might be why they haven’t sent out the emails yet
  [3/5/19, 21:38:36] Shannon: Don’t lose hope okay!!!
  [3/5/19, 21:38:40] Shannon: And don’t stress over this
  [3/5/19, 21:39:40] Yi Hein: Apparently they send all at once, not in batches
  [3/5/19, 21:39:51] Yi Hein: So I'm suspecting a waiting list
  [3/5/19, 21:43:02] Yi Hein: Did you get any rejection letter/ waitlist?
  [3/5/19, 21:43:09] Shannon: Nope didn’t get any email at all

  [31/5/19, 22:59:37] Shannon: i feel like all the portfolio stuff are quite useless in retrospect
  [31/5/19, 22:59:48] Shannon: i mean i obv didnt do all of them for the portfolio
  [31/5/19, 22:59:59] Shannon: like volunteering etc i did those cos i actually enjoyed it
  [31/5/19, 23:00:08] Shannon: but i dunno, i realise that objectively theyre all quite useless
  [31/5/19, 23:00:16] Shannon: like a star scholarship, ssef, 45 points etc
  [31/5/19, 23:00:36] Shannon: i mean what's the point of all that haha
  [31/5/19, 23:00:39] Shannon: when you think abt it now
  [31/5/19, 23:00:45] Shannon: i could have spent that time doing something else
  [31/5/19, 23:00:55] Shannon: interact exco and all that
  [31/5/19, 23:01:42] Yi Hein: Yeah that's sth I realise for this selection, portfolio is downplayed
  [31/5/19, 23:01:50] Shannon: yeah
  [31/5/19, 23:02:07] Yi Hein: quite a lot of ppl with good portfolios didn't get in
  [31/5/19, 23:02:15] Shannon: yeah
  [31/5/19, 23:02:31] Yi Hein: Hmmm but I don't regret doing any of it
  [31/5/19, 23:02:36] Shannon: really
  [31/5/19, 23:02:48] Yi Hein: Even if I know that it would lower my chances to Med school I'll still do it
  [31/5/19, 23:02:50] Shannon: that's good

  [1/7/17, 19:56:07] claudia 🍏: Hmm when I handled the printing of the house leaders tee, it took about 1.5 weeks to get senior admin approval, 1 week to finalize the artwork with the supplier, and at least 10 days for supplier to print LMAO how fun ok so should we settle on an idea ASAP seeing that we have so... little.... time....? 😭😭
  [1/7/17, 19:59:17] jonathan tan: What's the most cost efficient idea we have so far haha
  [1/7/17, 20:08:52] claudia 🍏: Ermz tbh replicating the pin thing would be pretty easy - i have the contact of the supplier who produced it/can produce it (lulz sorry memory hazy) + what are the chances of the teachers damning an idea that they approved of previously right...
  [1/7/17, 20:25:35] Emily Phang: Wait are we doing that for the graduating cohort though
  [1/7/17, 20:25:39] Emily Phang: The pins thing

  [3/7/17, 08:06:19] Emily Phang: Oops sorry late to the rave
  [3/7/17, 08:06:41] Emily Phang: Hi I'm Emily ummmm house Capt yas and not shady at all!¡!¡!¡
  [3/7/17, 08:09:47] Emily Phang: Oh yes but do y'all wanna think of a backup gift in case the pins don't work out
  [3/7/17, 08:13:42] Emily Phang: Also ya this is okay right?
  [3/7/17, 09:42:49] Mannat: Hey there Mannat here from sc !
  [3/7/17, 09:44:02] Mannat: I was wondering if for the pins, we could write leaders or smth somewhere bc otherwise it might just seem like a graduating gift instead of a graduating leaders gift
  [3/7/17, 09:45:07] Mannat: But if ya'll think it's fine, we should just go with it!
  [3/7/17, 09:45:43] Mannat: Mugs 😬
  [3/7/17, 09:51:09] claudia 🍏: Hmmm the 2015 pins were for GLAD too 🤔🤔 But I guess we could
  [3/7/17, 10:11:30] Samuel Chang: Has the person got back to u on how much it costs?
  [3/7/17, 10:19:50] claudia 🍏: He said that the pin was of a 3D effect and so we need a minimum of 500 pieces to order lmaOo 
  
  I asked him if he could print the whole thing in 2D (2D is like the normal SC/House Captain/PB badge without the engraving), which is about $3/piece
  [3/7/17, 10:20:06] claudia 🍏: But he hasn't replied
  [3/7/17, 10:20:51] Samuel Chang: Ok thanks
  [3/7/17, 10:36:14] claudia 🍏: Do y'all think it will look weird in 2D ahaha
  [3/7/17, 10:39:36] Emily Phang: Ummmmm it may be a bit dodgy but meh it should be fine
  [3/7/17, 10:49:30] claudia 🍏: Yeeee
  [3/7/17, 10:49:41] claudia 🍏: What are our other options ahaha
  [3/7/17, 10:58:13] Emily Phang: ^ This I guess?

  [3/7/17, 11:19:44] Yi Hein: Everyone just add on?
  [3/7/17, 11:20:21] Yi Hein: We can check with any supplier you know for each idea, see which one is more feasible
  [3/7/17, 11:20:53] Yi Hein: Oh yeah btw I'm Yi Hein from SC!
  [3/7/17, 11:42:37] claudia 🍏: Haha we gotta keep in mind the timeframe though - it takes a long time to make anything 😩
  [3/7/17, 13:34:13] claudia 🍏: The guy said he can print 2D by 28/07
  [3/7/17, 13:34:21] claudia 🍏: But should we go ahead or nah
  [3/7/17, 13:58:53] Yi Hein: Might be quite risky since we won't have much buffer time
  [3/7/17, 13:59:07] Yi Hein: Hmmm what do you guys think?
  [3/7/17, 14:03:20] claudia 🍏: As in before the 28th haha but yeah 🤔🤔🤔 What did they do for door gifts last year ah

  [3/7/17, 16:47:27] claudia 🍏: Idk the badge guy probably could
  [3/7/17, 16:48:10] claudia 🍏: Our school always engages him to supply events so should be ok... the worry is the cost lmaO
  [3/7/17, 16:48:26] Samuel Chang: I see
  [3/7/17, 16:48:32] Samuel Chang: Did he get back on the pins?
  [3/7/17, 16:48:57] claudia 🍏: If everyone is paying then does budget matter
  [3/7/17, 16:49:15] claudia 🍏: Yeah he said he can
  [3/7/17, 16:50:25] Samuel Chang: How much time and money?
  [3/7/17, 16:50:34] Samuel Chang: Cus we don't want them to pay too much
  [3/7/17, 16:50:41] Samuel Chang: Normally it's just for the meal I think
  [3/7/17, 16:52:29] Samuel Chang: If u get a quote then I can ask sir
  [3/7/17, 16:52:32] claudia 🍏: Wait you're talking about the old 2017 pin idea right
  [3/7/17, 16:52:37] Samuel Chang: Yep
  [3/7/17, 16:52:46] claudia 🍏: $3/piece
  [3/7/17, 16:52:58] Samuel Chang: But minimum 500 rip
  [3/7/17, 16:53:13] claudia 🍏: Nono the 2D one is $3/piece HAAHA
  [3/7/17, 16:53:14] Emily Phang: Can you ask the badge guy about this
  [3/7/17, 16:53:22] Samuel Chang: Oh lol okok
  [3/7/17, 16:53:29] Samuel Chang: So he can make lah
  [3/7/17, 16:53:41] Samuel Chang: Also he can do it by 28th
  [3/7/17, 16:53:54] claudia 🍏: Yeeee but the pin seems..,,,, so unlegit compared to the 2015 😩
  [3/7/17, 16:54:00] claudia 🍏: I'll ask for the other one
  [3/7/17, 16:54:42] claudia 🍏: Sam do you mind helping me to take the dimensions of the 2015 one haha
  [3/7/17, 16:54:47] Samuel Chang: Ok wait I just ask sir first but tell him we r fonsirdreing other things
  [3/7/17, 16:54:56] claudia 🍏: So I can gauge how big the badge should be
  [3/7/17, 16:57:18] Samuel Chang: It's about 9.4 x 9.4 cm2
  [3/7/17, 16:57:52] claudia 🍏: Thanks!!
  [3/7/17, 17:08:18] Samuel Chang: Dumo asks of the pin is metallic
  [3/7/17, 17:12:46] claudia 🍏: No it's just like the SC/House Captain/PB rectangular badge material
  [3/7/17, 17:14:00] claudia 🍏: Are we likely to go ahead with the 2 sided crest thingy if cost is okay? Don't wanna waste the guy's time too qhahaha
  [3/7/17, 17:24:23] Emily Phang: Yeah tbh if the cost is okay I think it's a good idea
  [3/7/17, 18:32:36] Samuel Chang: Yea can what's the material of the retangular badge?
  [3/7/17, 18:33:13] Samuel Chang: And yah just confirm the 2 sided badge thing for price
  [3/7/17, 19:56:34] Akash: So is the pin decided?
  [3/7/17, 19:57:07] Akash: There's this website with cheap and cool stuff. I think some may suit our graduation aspect gifts.

  [3/7/17, 19:58:30] Akash: http://www.onedollaronly.com.sg
  [3/7/17, 20:00:08] Akash: Can we get them thumb drives instead? With GLAD 2017 engraved?
  [3/7/17, 20:00:22] Akash: Store Memories lol
  [3/7/17, 20:01:08] Samuel Chang: Will it be ex?
  [3/7/17, 20:01:29] Akash: I'll check it out
  [3/7/17, 20:15:51] claudia 🍏: The supplier is still checking
  [3/7/17, 20:16:38] claudia 🍏: Ahahaha
  [3/7/17, 20:16:41] claudia 🍏: But people don't really use thumb drives nowadays right 🤔🤔🤔
  [3/7/17, 20:18:33] Emily Phang: You need it for FOA slides!!
  [3/7/17, 20:19:18] Yi Hein: Hmmm I think shield crest thingy would have more "sentimental" 😂 Maybe if that doesn't work out then consider the thumb drive thing
  [3/7/17, 20:20:26] Yi Hein: Sam, is Dumo okay with that idea?
  [3/7/17, 21:00:47] Samuel Chang: Let the supplier confirm first then I'll ask
  [3/7/17, 21:16:37] Justin Lee: if y'all need I might be able to get the thumb drives from a supplier that supplied for my graduation
  [3/7/17, 21:17:08] Akash: Get a quote

  [3/7/17, 21:59:39] jonathan tan: As for quantity around 175 there?
  [3/7/17, 22:00:43] Justin Lee: okey thanks
  [3/7/17, 22:01:12] claudia 🍏: We'll probably have to add a design to the thumb drive right
  [3/7/17, 22:01:25] claudia 🍏: So gotta let your supplier know too!
  [3/7/17, 22:01:33] Justin Lee: okey sure
  [3/7/17, 22:50:49] Justin Lee: the supplier I contacted advised me like to get something else cos like thumb drives aren't that useful nowadays
  [3/7/17, 22:50:56] Justin Lee: unless yall still want it
  [3/7/17, 22:54:42] Akash: How much is it tho? Did he tell u?

  ‎[3/7/17, 22:57:04] Samuel Chang: ‎image omitted
  [3/7/17, 22:57:07] Samuel Chang: Guys sir I helping us email the china factory to see if they can make our original plan A pins (but metallic so better)
  [3/7/17, 22:57:52] Samuel Chang: So right now the badge and thumbdrive ideas are on hold, but just check the pricing and all that first just in case China isn't fast enough
  [3/7/17, 23:01:28] claudia 🍏: China would be the jinsheu supplier right? Hmm maybe they can, because they only take 21 days if no sample is required
  [3/7/17, 23:01:51] Samuel Chang: Yea hopefully cus he's emailing them now
  [3/7/17, 23:02:08] Samuel Chang: Damn u seem experienced in Chinese suppliers
  [3/7/17, 23:02:13] claudia 🍏: He's asking for the 2017 pin issit
  [3/7/17, 23:02:25] Samuel Chang: Yep
  [3/7/17, 23:02:37] claudia 🍏: No la we had to contact them for some other house shit wheeheet
  [3/7/17, 23:04:04] claudia 🍏: Does that mean we scrap the two-sided badge if China is fast enough
  [3/7/17, 23:04:47] Samuel Chang: I think so :/
  [3/7/17, 23:06:34] claudia 🍏: Hmm because if the cost is not too bad, I feel the token thing is more meaningful than a generic 2017 🤔 But we see how things goes luh ;)););;)
  [3/7/17, 23:06:47] Samuel Chang: Yea
  [3/7/17, 23:07:08] Samuel Chang: Did u manage to find the cost of the badge
  [3/7/17, 23:07:53] claudia 🍏: I think he's still checking

  [7/7/17, 18:29:02] claudia 🍏: Btw guys
  [7/7/17, 18:29:49] claudia 🍏: Dumo said we can't mass produce door gifts aka whatever gifts we plan can't be produced from a factory.,,.,.,. LmaoOoooO rip we gotta make our own
  [7/7/17, 18:30:10] claudia 🍏: And he said just cards were lame so we gotta think of something 😩😩
  [7/7/17, 18:30:30] jonathan tan: Wot 😩😩
  [7/7/17, 18:30:33] jonathan tan: Rip
  [7/7/17, 18:30:46] evan tan: Wait whaaaaaaat
  [7/7/17, 18:30:47] Yi Hein: Wait both suppliers can't?
  [7/7/17, 18:31:01] claudia 🍏: Cannot get from any supplier at all
  [7/7/17, 18:31:11] evan tan: But y tho
  ‎[7/7/17, 18:31:31] claudia 🍏: ‎audio omitted
  [7/7/17, 18:31:50] claudia 🍏: Soz IT WAS MY SISTER PLZ IGNORE
  [7/7/17, 18:32:33] claudia 🍏: Idk man it was pretty sudden
  [7/7/17, 18:32:41] claudia 🍏: What do y'all think we should do then
  [7/7/17, 18:33:30] Yi Hein: Probably from the higher ups ...
  [7/7/17, 18:40:35] Yi Hein: Hmmm just a random idea, I was thinking maybe try DIY claudia's idea. Like we can buy ply wood from daiso and cut into the shape of ACS crest and paste sticker on the front and print their names on the back?
  [7/7/17, 18:40:44] evan tan: Maybe we just think of a door gift for those graduating only
  [7/7/17, 18:40:54] Yi Hein: Not sure if feasible cause it seem like quite a lot of work and the cutting is hard
  [7/7/17, 18:41:04] Yi Hein: Yeah ^^^
  [7/7/17, 18:41:56] Jerome: When do we have to collate the attendances of the express prefects who are coming or not?
  [7/7/17, 19:01:31] claudia 🍏: Yeah only the seniors
  [7/7/17, 19:02:40] claudia 🍏: Hmm yeah maybe we should skype/meet soon to talk through all these stuff (GLAD is in 3 weeks 😩😩)
  [7/7/17, 19:02:48] claudia 🍏: By next week can?
  [7/7/17, 19:05:04] Jerome: Ok sure
  [7/7/17, 19:27:27] Akash: Calm down we got this!! Essentially all the things we have to organise are
  
  *1. Caterer and Food*
  Collecting Dietary Restrictions and attendance
  (Let's do this by Tuesday)
  
  Get good and caterer
  Last year, we had a sit down catering which was according to a lot of people very ex ($40) for okok food. Many of them want Buffet which they feel is good good and cheap
  
  
  
  *2. Performances and Speech*
  Right now how many slots have been filled and how many more are needed?
  (Let's sort this out by this Friday)
  
  
  
  *3. Gifts*
  So currently we have to give DIY Gifts only? Am I right? I'm still unsure about this. 
  
  If it's DIY, Let's do this:
  Get like the gift plastic from Daiso. It's comes with Thank Yiu stickers also I've seen it before. Then we get like Mars and Snickers or something then each person get 1 of each brand (The small one). Also we can include the graduating Pen and book and I sent earlier. It won't even be that ex and it actually reflects the Graduating and appreciating part I think. 
  
  
  Thanks
  [7/7/17, 19:28:00] Akash: *4. Venue*
  [7/7/17, 19:28:36] Jerome: Logs too rite?
  ‎[7/7/17, 19:28:53] Akash: ‎image omitted
  [7/7/17, 19:48:07] claudia 🍏: House and Council already collected dietary restrictions - can PB do it ASAP too?
  [7/7/17, 19:48:07] claudia 🍏: Then I'll submit to Mdm
  [7/7/17, 19:48:48] claudia 🍏: I think the teachers are handling the catering so we wont have to handle that part
  [7/7/17, 19:50:46] claudia 🍏: Also uhh I think Dumo intends for the DIY gift to be more personalized/meaningful; he gave an example of some jars with fancy notes written by juniors that kinda thing
  [7/7/17, 20:09:34] evan tan: But the prob is is that like majority of us arent even close to alot of the graduating batch
  [7/7/17, 23:02:42] Yi Hein: https://www.google.com.sg/amp/www.instructables.com/id/Exploding-Box/%3Famp_page%3Dtrue
  [7/7/17, 23:03:04] Yi Hein: Found this ^^^^ seems doable and meaningful but it'll be quite a lot of effort
  [7/7/17, 23:04:13] Justin Lee: but it doesn't explode haish
  [7/7/17, 23:05:07] Yi Hein: Explodes with memories 😂
  [7/7/17, 23:05:18] Justin Lee: oo tru
  [7/7/17, 23:06:02] Justin Lee: but it's gonna take q a long time and we have 3 weeks left? idk
  [7/7/17, 23:06:15] Jerome: Yea
  ‎[7/7/17, 23:07:00] Yi Hein: ‎image omitted
  [7/7/17, 23:07:18] Jerome: Sure thanks!
  [7/7/17, 23:07:20] Justin Lee: I guess that'll worl
  [7/7/17, 23:07:26] Justin Lee: thanks then! :)
  [7/7/17, 23:08:58] Yi Hein: Thanks for compiling all this! 😊
  [7/7/17, 23:12:47] Yi Hein: Actually right, if we get the junior councillors and house leaders to help make these, we might be able to make it in time
  [7/7/17, 23:13:42] Yi Hein: It's just a suggestion though, if y'all find more ideas just post it here
  ‎[7/7/17, 23:18:55] Justin Lee: ‎image omitted
  [7/7/17, 23:21:58] claudia 🍏: Oooo nice ideas guys
  [7/7/17, 23:24:16] Samuel Chang: Wow all this stuff pretty aesthetic
  [7/7/17, 23:24:28] claudia 🍏: Hmm yea this seems pretty cool and simple too
  [7/7/17, 23:24:31] Samuel Chang: How bout we get help from the various bodies
  [7/7/17, 23:24:36] Samuel Chang: Like we prob can't do it alone
  [7/7/17, 23:24:37] claudia 🍏: Is the exploding box supposed to explode
  [7/7/17, 23:24:43] claudia 🍏: Yeaahh
  [7/7/17, 23:24:46] Jerome: Need help from PB?
  [7/7/17, 23:24:49] claudia 🍏: Do we have a budget for this
  [7/7/17, 23:24:51] Samuel Chang: We get ppl to help make
  [7/7/17, 23:24:54] Samuel Chang: Then write
  [7/7/17, 23:24:58] claudia 🍏: Like to buy the stuff
  [7/7/17, 23:25:13] Samuel Chang: Idk
  [7/7/17, 23:25:14] claudia 🍏: Or do we have to make everyone pay for the cost 🤔
  [7/7/17, 23:25:53] Justin Lee: we don't have a budget right? cos we still make them pay for the door gift
  [7/7/17, 23:26:08] Jerome: But like brainstorm all the ideas first
  [7/7/17, 23:26:10] Samuel Chang: I can help ask once we settle on a idea
  [7/7/17, 23:26:13] Samuel Chang: ^^
  [7/7/17, 23:26:17] Jerome: Then decide ok which gifts
  [7/7/17, 23:26:21] Jerome: On*
  [7/7/17, 23:27:04] claudia 🍏: Tbh the frame thing seems pretty cool and doable
  [7/7/17, 23:28:19] Jerome: The door gifts must be DIY rite?
  [7/7/17, 23:28:29] Akash: Yup
  [7/7/17, 23:28:48] Justin Lee: so our current ideas
  1. exploding box that doesn't explode :(
  2. frame thingamajig
  [7/7/17, 23:29:10] claudia 🍏: Where can we buy real cheap frames like those
  [7/7/17, 23:29:13] claudia 🍏: IKEA?
  [7/7/17, 23:29:24] Jerome: Daiso?
  [7/7/17, 23:29:25] Akash: IKEA is ex
  [7/7/17, 23:29:30] Akash: Daiso is cheap
  [7/7/17, 23:29:38] Justin Lee: diaso one is like 2 bucks
  [7/7/17, 23:29:42] Justin Lee: but idk about bulk
  [7/7/17, 23:29:46] Akash: Same
  [7/7/17, 23:31:19] Justin Lee: like for diaso all the sizes are 2 bucks so u have a pretty large choice
  ‎[8/7/17, 00:01:53] Mannat: ‎image omitted
  [8/7/17, 00:02:12] Justin Lee: ooo
  [8/7/17, 00:02:28] Akash: Looks simple and really elegant
  [8/7/17, 00:02:59] Akash: We need really intricate hands not clumsy ones like mine😜 tho
  [8/7/17, 00:03:12] Justin Lee: ^^^samse
  [8/7/17, 09:27:12] claudia 🍏: There's a group frisbee kids in Y6 who can perform too
  [8/7/17, 18:04:19] claudia 🍏: Hihi can I check if someone is already compiling the dietary restrictions for PB
  [8/7/17, 18:07:00] Justin Lee: yup we r getting
  [8/7/17, 18:52:27] claudia 🍏: Nice nice thanks
  [8/7/17, 18:53:39] Mannat: Okk shall we do a vote on the door gift so we can get it approved + start prepping soon !
  [8/7/17, 18:53:46] Jerome: Ok
  [8/7/17, 18:56:03] claudia 🍏: Hmm I feel the frame thing is the most feasible + meaningful!! What do y'all think
  [8/7/17, 18:56:14] Justin Lee: so our current ideas
  1. exploding box that doesn't explode :(
  2. frame thingamajig
  3. cool glass tubes
  [8/7/17, 18:56:29] Jerome: Agree haha!
  [8/7/17, 18:57:53] Yi Hein: ^^^
  [8/7/17, 19:04:04] Jerome: When is the deadline?
  [8/7/17, 19:17:53] evan tan: Yeah and the most cost efficient thing also
  [8/7/17, 19:31:41] claudia 🍏: As soon as you can :-)
  [8/7/17, 19:31:54] claudia 🍏: Hahaha what about the rest?
  [8/7/17, 19:32:43] Jerome: Ok
  [8/7/17, 22:05:50] Samuel Chang: Guys Klaus messaged me he can't make it :/
  [8/7/17, 22:05:55] Samuel Chang: We need to find someone else
  [8/7/17, 22:06:06] Akash: I can do that
  [8/7/17, 22:06:19] Akash: I'm in photog. Actually I can cover the event
  [8/7/17, 22:06:33] claudia 🍏: We have Dhruva and Pak
  [8/7/17, 22:06:42] Akash: Anyways, I'll look for a photographer
  [8/7/17, 22:06:47] claudia 🍏: Pak takes the photo booth and Dhruva can walk around
  [8/7/17, 22:07:16] claudia 🍏: They just agreed AHAHA
  [8/7/17, 22:07:28] Akash: Gr8
  [8/7/17, 22:07:50] claudia 🍏: Thanks m8s
  [8/7/17, 22:41:19] evan tan: In the shower i just got the idea that we can do this and replace the house with the clock tower
  [9/7/17, 10:42:36] claudia 🍏: Ooo
  [9/7/17, 10:42:43] claudia 🍏: Do we have a digital copy of the clock tower
  [9/7/17, 10:43:30] claudia 🍏: Also is it possible to get one more performance act from the PB? Then we're pretty much settled haha
  [9/7/17, 10:56:34] Justin Lee: okey we'll try to find another
  [9/7/17, 11:35:34] evan tan: We can ask the person who designed the homecoming shirt !!!!!!!
  [9/7/17, 11:53:02] claudia 🍏: Oh that's Jill then
  [9/7/17, 11:54:00] claudia 🍏: We should prolly start on the gift ASAP because it'll take a lot of time to make and write 😩
  [9/7/17, 11:54:20] claudia 🍏: Anyone passing by Daiso today?
  [9/7/17, 11:58:58] Justin Lee: I might
  [9/7/17, 11:59:23] Justin Lee: but we need to seek approval before we buy right
  [9/7/17, 11:59:57] claudia 🍏: Yeee just to check out the frames to see if they're suitable I guess
  [9/7/17, 12:00:10] Justin Lee: uhhh what frames do y'all want
  [9/7/17, 12:00:20] Justin Lee: cos I actually just went so I kinda know what they have
  [9/7/17, 12:00:29] evan tan: Maybe we do one about the size of an a4 piece of paper lah
  [9/7/17, 12:00:57] claudia 🍏: Plain ones like the one in Jerome's picture
  [9/7/17, 12:01:18] Jerome: That's Justin's lol
  [9/7/17, 12:01:18] Justin Lee: Jerome's pic?
  [9/7/17, 12:01:23] Justin Lee: o that
  [9/7/17, 12:01:29] claudia 🍏: OH SOZ
  [9/7/17, 12:01:33] Justin Lee: yup they have that in like millions of sizes
  [9/7/17, 12:01:35] claudia 🍏: Yeeee the frame thingy
  [9/7/17, 12:01:45] Justin Lee: but we may need to contact them to bulk order
  [9/7/17, 12:02:05] Jerome: Uhh
  [9/7/17, 12:02:09] claudia 🍏: Can't we just run to different Daiso stores until we get 81 xdxd
  [9/7/17, 12:02:14] evan tan: Oh ya fuhhh
  [9/7/17, 12:02:18] evan tan: Maybe ikea???
  [9/7/17, 12:02:22] Jerome: We are gonna write notes on it rite?
  [9/7/17, 12:02:34] claudia 🍏: Yeah make the hot air balloon thing
  [9/7/17, 12:02:36] Justin Lee: IKEA quite ex
  [9/7/17, 12:02:39] Jerome: Ok
  [9/7/17, 12:02:52] Justin Lee: for a set of frames it's like 12+?
  [9/7/17, 12:03:01] Justin Lee: and it's like 3 or 4 only
  [9/7/17, 12:03:10] claudia 🍏: Justin did they give instructions on how to make it
  [9/7/17, 12:03:14] claudia 🍏: Or we just follow the picture
  [9/7/17, 12:03:14] Jerome: We can ask the entire PB to write or like it's just us writing stuff?
  [9/7/17, 12:03:21] Justin Lee: uhhhhhhh nope
  [9/7/17, 12:03:25] Justin Lee: but it's q simple
  [9/7/17, 12:03:39] claudia 🍏: Ask the people in your boards to write
  [9/7/17, 12:03:42] Justin Lee: just a background, string and post its
  [9/7/17, 12:04:27] Jerome: So like u just need coloured and paper strings
  [9/7/17, 12:04:34] Justin Lee: do y'all want to like conceal it from the seniors or something
  [9/7/17, 12:04:57] Jerome: Coloured paper and strings*
  [9/7/17, 12:04:58] claudia 🍏: We'll try to get approval from Dumo tmrw and then we can start
  [9/7/17, 12:05:10] claudia 🍏: We have to make 81 xdxd
  [9/7/17, 12:05:16] Justin Lee: oh
  [9/7/17, 12:05:23] claudia 🍏: Get the juniors to write
  [9/7/17, 12:05:23] Justin Lee: sounds fun
  [9/7/17, 12:05:26] Jerome: Umm as for the "house" in that photo can we replace it with the ACS logo?
  [9/7/17, 12:05:29] Jerome: Ok
  [9/7/17, 12:06:17] claudia 🍏: Hmm Evan suggested the clock tower too
  [9/7/17, 12:06:31] Jerome: That's a good idea
  [9/7/17, 12:07:01] Jerome: How bout putting them both in he frame?
  [9/7/17, 12:08:20] Justin Lee: huh
  [9/7/17, 12:09:51] claudia 🍏: Huh
  [9/7/17, 12:10:18] Jerome: As in the clock tower and ACS logo
  [9/7/17, 12:10:30] Jerome: Put both of them on the coloured paper
  [9/7/17, 12:11:19] Justin Lee: we could incorporate it in I guess
  [9/7/17, 12:23:50] Justin Lee: just checking do we only have one available performance spot
  [9/7/17, 12:24:51] Jerome: Just to confirm speeches only 1 person from PB rite?
  [9/7/17, 12:25:02] claudia 🍏: Current acts
  1. Frisbee-kids-are-performing-but-IDK-what
  2. Magician from Y2
  3. Back on Track
  4. Y6 house capts
  [9/7/17, 12:25:09] claudia 🍏: Did I miss out something
  [9/7/17, 12:25:27] claudia 🍏: Minimally 5 acts maximum 8
  [9/7/17, 12:25:31] claudia 🍏: Yeah only 1 speech
  [9/7/17, 12:25:41] Justin Lee: oo ic thanks
  [9/7/17, 17:54:55] Justin Lee: a group of prefects intend to sing and play something
  [9/7/17, 17:55:05] Justin Lee: and exco is considering on whether they should perform
  [9/7/17, 17:55:46] Justin Lee: Current acts

  2. Magician from Y2
  3. Back on Track

  [9/7/17, 19:58:34] Jerome: For the speech thing is it possible for a joint speech?
  [9/7/17, 19:58:45] Jerome: Like by 2 graduating prefects
  [9/7/17, 19:59:15] Jerome: But together
  [9/7/17, 20:06:23] Samuel Chang: How would that work?
  [9/7/17, 20:26:12] claudia 🍏: They take turns talking I guess
  [9/7/17, 20:26:30] claudia 🍏: Should be fine but *must be* less than 5 minutes
  [9/7/17, 20:26:46] claudia 🍏: We can help you check with Mr Dumo tmrw!
  [9/7/17, 20:28:24] Jerome: Each?
  [9/7/17, 20:29:18] claudia 🍏: Together
  [9/7/17, 20:29:25] Jerome: Ok

  [9/7/17, 21:13:04] Yi Hein: Yup looks good!
  [9/7/17, 21:13:31] Yi Hein: Would we have enough space to write though, seems a bit small
  [9/7/17, 21:13:45] Justin Lee: there r bigger sizes
  [9/7/17, 21:14:14] Yi Hein: Oh ok great 👍🏼
  [9/7/17, 21:41:40] jonathan tan: Hi guys, from the meeting if I recall correctly we need to submit a completed MR Requisition form or something by 14 July right?
  [9/7/17, 21:46:20] jonathan tan: Also, are we gonna suggest a different venue for GLAD or are we gonna stick with old mph since Audi 1 can't be used
  [9/7/17, 21:49:06] Yi Hein: Hmm I would think the Teachers would have considered all available venues before deciding on old mph...so yeah let's just stick to it
  [9/7/17, 21:49:59] evan tan: Me and claudia are thinking of the new boarding school dining hall
  [9/7/17, 21:50:20] evan tan: We will check it out tmr and try to ask for it if we can haha
  [9/7/17, 21:51:33] Yi Hein: Yeah actly that sounds much better if its available, we can check with them tmr

  [9/7/17, 22:25:33] Justin Lee: yikes i made some mistakes which thankfully ivan spotted so heres the amended list
  [10/7/17, 12:57:37] claudia 🍏: Thanks Justin!
  [10/7/17, 12:57:57] claudia 🍏: We can go ahead with the frame thing ;););)
  [10/7/17, 14:57:04] Justin Lee: ooo great
  [10/7/17, 14:57:17] Justin Lee: so we've been given permission to spend $$?
  [10/7/17, 15:41:06] claudia 🍏: Yup $300 budget wheehee
  [10/7/17, 15:41:24] claudia 🍏: But we must pay in cash and submit the receipts within two weeks
  [10/7/17, 15:42:13] evan tan: So when should we meet up and buy the stuff
  [10/7/17, 15:42:35] Yi Hein: ^ receipts must not contain names (eg. from credit card, membership card)
  [10/7/17, 15:42:49] claudia 🍏: Tbh we just need one person to buy first
  [10/7/17, 15:42:57] claudia 🍏: Like one frame to test out
  [10/7/17, 15:43:08] claudia 🍏: Red blue yellow for the balloons part
  [10/7/17, 15:43:35] evan tan: Mmmm
  [10/7/17, 15:46:20] Justin Lee: sticky notes?
  [10/7/17, 15:46:47] evan tan: we will probably cut out paper in the shape of balloons
  [10/7/17, 15:47:00] Yi Hein: Coloured paper will do
  [10/7/17, 18:44:35] claudia 🍏: Yeah coloured paper
  [10/7/17, 18:45:14] claudia 🍏: We have to assemble them into the balloon shape and let the juniors write first before we stick it on the frame
  [10/7/17, 19:30:28] evan tan: I got the paperrrrr
  [10/7/17, 19:30:55] Emily Phang: Aye nice
  [10/7/17, 19:43:12] Justin Lee: so do y'all need me to get frames?
  [10/7/17, 19:49:00] claudia 🍏: Hihi here are some things that we needa settle asap 😛😛😛😛
  
  1. Confirm performance list by tomorrow - Mdm wants it ASAP. Need to find out the names of the people performing in each act and the MR equipment that they require. Prefects can help us check if the PB exco is performing?
  
  2. Do up a sample of the gift asap, so that we can mobilise the rest of PB/SC/House to help us make the rest. The space inside the borders of the frame should be bigger than a A4 piece of paper + preferable if the borders are thin (like the one in Justin's photo)
  
  3. Confirm who is making the speeches - House should be Paige. For PB, Mdm said to check with Mr George Lam if it is permissible for two prefects to be making the speech together. Is it possible to confirm the list (TBH only 3 names lmao) by Wednesday?
  [10/7/17, 19:53:30] claudia 🍏: Whoever's checking with the acts just add on to this list xdxdxdxdxd

  [10/7/17, 20:07:26] Emily Phang: Maybe we should try first
  [10/7/17, 20:12:44] Yi Hein: I'd think try buy one first, do up the sample, show the Teachers just to confirm

  [10/7/17, 20:12:58] claudia 🍏: Okay let's do that then

  [10/7/17, 20:14:39] Yi Hein: Claudia did you mean A3? A5 is smaller than A4
  [10/7/17, 20:14:42] claudia 🍏: Has the PB EXCO confirmed if they're performing?
  [10/7/17, 20:14:48] claudia 🍏: Oh yeah A3 soz

  [10/7/17, 20:15:12] claudia 🍏: No not like a picture, but like a drawn-on-photoshop that kinda thang
  [10/7/17, 20:15:44] Jerome: So we need someone to draw it and photoshop it?
  [10/7/17, 20:16:09] Justin Lee: can get from homecoming rite?
  [10/7/17, 20:16:20] Emily Phang: Ya

  [11/7/17, 22:51:38] evan tan: But we cut so many alrdy haizz
  [11/7/17, 22:51:41] claudia 🍏: I'm trimming all the ones we cut just now
  [11/7/17, 22:51:51] evan tan: Okay maybe we do like 2 big and the rest smaller
  [11/7/17, 22:52:19] evan tan: Because there will be those who have stuff to say and those who write because they just trynna be cool

  [11/7/17, 22:54:56] Justin Lee: is like mid next week.pos
  [11/7/17, 22:55:07] Justin Lee: then we still need to let them write
  [11/7/17, 22:55:53] Jerome: ^^
  [11/7/17, 22:56:13] claudia 🍏: We try our best to do up one sample by tmrw
  [11/7/17, 22:56:22] claudia 🍏: What do ya mean ahah
  [11/7/17, 22:58:20] Justin Lee: like overlap the side balloons less
  [11/7/17, 22:59:04] Jerome: Cos we need more space to write stuff
  [11/7/17, 22:59:30] Jerome: So like shift the balloons slightly more as what Justin said
  [11/7/17, 22:59:48] claudia 🍏: No la not the space for the writing part
  [11/7/17, 22:59:56] claudia 🍏: Because currently the balloons look huge
  [11/7/17, 23:00:00] claudia 🍏: Like against the A4
  [11/7/17, 23:00:37] Jerome: Ohh okkk sorry lol
  [11/7/17, 23:01:36] claudia 🍏: Nahh don't worry
  [11/7/17, 23:02:40] claudia 🍏: Jerome Justin Ivan and Akash, maybe we leave the video to y'all to take charge? We can discuss it all together but y'all make the calls ;-) Or how should we do this?
  [11/7/17, 23:03:43] Jerome: Um we have to merge SC and PB rite?
  [11/7/17, 23:04:00] Jerome: Or u prefer them separately
  [11/7/17, 23:04:39] Samuel Chang: I think merge is fine
  [11/7/17, 23:05:19] claudia 🍏: YeAh as long as there are a few people in charge of it
  [11/7/17, 23:05:38] Jerome: Hmm but we need the Junior SC councillor peeps to like say their words of appreciation for their seniors
  [11/7/17, 23:06:00] Jerome: Is that possible?

  [11/7/17, 23:40:23] claudia 🍏: Looks better? The actual thing will be printed without borders so should be ok right?
  [11/7/17, 23:43:48] Samuel Chang: I think it's ok but should we give more writing space?
  [11/7/17, 23:44:08] Samuel Chang: Cus some balloon spaces really can't write
  [11/7/17, 23:44:33] Samuel Chang: Should we allow them to wrote on the negative space if they want to write more
  [11/7/17, 23:45:49] claudia 🍏: We're limited by the frame size thooo
  [11/7/17, 23:46:21] claudia 🍏: Also @sam @yi Hein @evan @jon don't cut your papers if you haven't ya, the balloons gotta be smaller

  [12/7/17, 21:53:20] claudia 🍏: Preferably send in the logs by the end of the weekend? We just need a rough idea of what we're gonna do and what logs we need (to buy) that kinda thang ;-))
  [12/7/17, 21:56:44] Justin Lee: will we be able to make changes after that?
  [12/7/17, 21:58:35] claudia 🍏: Not too drastic ones I guess
  ‎[12/7/17, 21:58:45] claudia 🍏: ‎image omitted
  [12/7/17, 21:58:53] claudia 🍏: Lmao..,,, Old MPH 😩😩😩😩💦
  [12/7/17, 21:59:47] Samuel Chang: Well then
  [12/7/17, 22:02:42] evan tan: Maybe we should do similar to that one
  [12/7/17, 22:02:47] evan tan: Add some fairy lights or smth
  [12/7/17, 22:02:54] claudia 🍏: (also for the dudes cutting the balloons,, try to cut the edges nicely otherwise it'll be extra work to trim 😩) (pass to me when done)
  [12/7/17, 22:03:01] evan tan: Or use styrofoam and paint glad on it
  [12/7/17, 22:03:15] claudia 🍏: Gotta bear in mind we're hanging the cloth off a basketball hoop
  [12/7/17, 22:03:21] Samuel Chang: Wait Claudia when do u need?
  [12/7/17, 22:10:31] claudia 🍏: Uhh actually Idk because she only said "I hope to receive it soon" xdxdxdxd

  [12/7/17, 22:11:02] Samuel Chang: I see
  [12/7/17, 22:15:45] Emily Phang: If we're hanging the cloth...it may be easier to paint on the cloth but it may be high key ugly if we have 0 art skills
  [12/7/17, 22:16:11] Samuel Chang: Not sure if we r allowed to
  [12/7/17, 22:16:19] Samuel Chang: Also yah abt the art skills part
  [12/7/17, 22:16:54] claudia 🍏: We can keep it simple / use Evan's sick photoshop skillz
  [12/7/17, 22:17:27] Justin Lee: lolol dumb idea but
  [12/7/17, 22:17:30] claudia 🍏: I guess we could try to follow last year's,,, 🤔 Minimal art skills required
  [12/7/17, 22:17:33] Justin Lee: custom snapchat geofilters
  [12/7/17, 22:17:44] claudia 🍏: HAHAHA

  [12/7/17, 22:18:44] Jerome: Nope
  [12/7/17, 22:18:51] evan tan: I think that just a sign thaf says glad with some balloons is fine
  [12/7/17, 22:19:12] evan tan: All people really want are hd photos with a clean background 👌👌👌
  [12/7/17, 22:19:17] claudia 🍏: (Jerome and Akash maybe we leave you two to be IC of the video? ;;;;;))))
  [12/7/17, 22:19:26] Jerome: Ok sure
  [12/7/17, 22:19:55] claudia 🍏: But keep us in the loop regarding any scripting ya
  [12/7/17, 22:20:02] claudia 🍏: Tru
  [12/7/17, 22:20:27] Emily Phang: How do we wanna make the sign though
  [12/7/17, 22:20:45] evan tan: Maybe we use the flags like in the photo
  [12/7/17, 22:20:51] evan tan: Or we use styrofoam
  [12/7/17, 22:21:01] evan tan: Or even wood if we're ambitious 😩😩
  [12/7/17, 22:21:04] Emily Phang: HAHAHA
  [12/7/17, 22:21:09] Emily Phang: Oh yes wood carving time
  [12/7/17, 22:21:11] Emily Phang: Leggo
  [12/7/17, 22:21:16] claudia 🍏: Usually the council uses cardboard and paints it
  [12/7/17, 22:21:24] claudia 🍏: But yeah flags can work too
  [12/7/17, 22:21:30] Emily Phang: Aye okay how do we hang it though
  [12/7/17, 22:21:41] Justin Lee: or helium balloon then no need hang?

  [12/7/17, 22:22:45] claudia 🍏: ok to keep things simple maybe we all agree on copying last year's? ;););)(;);
  [12/7/17, 22:22:46] Yi Hein: There's a shop that can get helium, but if if the rope is cut...
  [12/7/17, 22:23:03] claudia 🍏: Can attach using pins and duct tape
  [12/7/17, 22:23:09] Emily Phang: HAHAHA K den
  [12/7/17, 22:23:14] Emily Phang: I'm fine with last year's
  [12/7/17, 22:23:23] Justin Lee: ik how to get helium if needed la
  [12/7/17, 22:23:38] Justin Lee: but I was thinking more of the balloon letters?
  [12/7/17, 22:23:42] Emily Phang: It's okay I think we can give the helium a miss?
  [12/7/17, 22:23:52] evan tan: Oh wait
  [12/7/17, 22:24:00] Emily Phang: We can casually chuck balloons around the hall
  [12/7/17, 22:24:08] claudia 🍏: Yeah that was our plan
  [12/7/17, 22:24:15] claudia 🍏: To make it seem less like old MPH
  [12/7/17, 22:24:20] Emily Phang: HAHAHA nice ;))
  [12/7/17, 22:24:32] Mannat: Yea I think we Should just paint on cardboard bc styrofoam is bad + the words on the flags might not be too visible ( can't really see on the photo Claudia sent)
  [12/7/17, 22:24:34] Emily Phang: Balloons full of our CO2 💯
  [12/7/17, 22:24:53] Yi Hein: SIDE TRACK: we confirm doing lip sync battle for games?

  [14/7/17, 15:20:46] claudia 🍏: Does that sound better than the basha poles?
  [14/7/17, 15:21:05] evan tan: Yeah sounds less ghetto lol
  [14/7/17, 15:42:46] Mannat: Yeah sounds good
  [14/7/17, 15:43:22] Samuel Chang: True

  [14/7/17, 19:55:10] claudia 🍏: Oh yes
  [14/7/17, 19:55:21] claudia 🍏: Justin are the black ones tacky
  [14/7/17, 19:55:23] Justin Lee: apparently they said the whole Singapore has no more stock
  [14/7/17, 19:55:33] claudia 🍏: I'm worried it looks tacky because of the grooves

  [14/7/17, 19:59:06] Justin Lee: ah shucks IKEA is painfully expensive
  [14/7/17, 19:59:12] evan tan: Oh wsit

  [14/7/17, 19:59:44] Yi Hein: That's the cheaper one hahahaha there's one for $18 each
  [14/7/17, 19:59:50] Justin Lee: honestly right we can just  pay like 200
  [14/7/17, 19:59:53] Justin Lee: out of budget
  [14/7/17, 20:00:05] Justin Lee: then like make everyone pay like 50cents more
  [14/7/17, 20:00:25] Justin Lee: or like 1 -2 bucks more
  [14/7/17, 20:00:41] Justin Lee: it's less burden on our budget and also doesn't rly affect them
  [14/7/17, 20:00:51] evan tan: Er
  [14/7/17, 20:00:53] evan tan: Okay lah
  [14/7/17, 20:01:00] evan tan: Anyone going ikea anytime soon
  [14/7/17, 20:02:18] Yi Hein: Anything to do with money better discuss with Teachers first
  [14/7/17, 20:03:40] evan tan: If the frames are $283.5 then the paper i bought is $15, lets say the printing of 81 pieces of paper is like $10, then it just exceeds the budget like a little bit
  [14/7/17, 20:03:51] claudia 🍏: Uhh no la I think the teachers would prefer that we spend the money we're allowed
  [14/7/17, 20:04:14] claudia 🍏: $3.5 not worth thoo
  [14/7/17, 20:06:37] Yi Hein: ^^^
  [14/7/17, 20:07:52] Yi Hein: No choice I Guess, low PED hahaha low degree of substitutability 😂

  [15/7/17, 11:18:53] claudia 🍏: Hi everyone! As some of you guys may already know, the Graduating Leaders Appreciation Dinner is coming round the corner ;-) This year, it will be held in the Old MPH on the 28th of July, at 6.30pm! Attire for the dinner is smart casual - for the ladies, nothing too $candalou$ (for example, no off-shoulders) please ☺ 
  
  The dinner will include a Real Delicious buffet - we'll be collecting $10 from each of you to pay for this! 🤑 We've tried our best to cut down this year's dinner cost following feedback from last year's GLAD; but if any of y'all have issues with the cost, please let the committee know and we'll see what we can do :-)
  
  Please try to pass us the money on 17/07 or 19/07 during the invest rehearsal - for prefects, you can pass it to either Justin Lee or Ivan Wong. For councillors and house captains, you can pass it to either Jonathan Tan, Emily Phang, Claudia Tan or Evan Tan 👌🏻👌🏻
  [15/7/17, 11:18:55] claudia 🍏: Does this work
  [15/7/17, 11:19:21] claudia 🍏: The video people don't need to handle the money collection part bah ;-)
  [15/7/17, 11:19:47] Emily Phang: Yup okay sounds good thanks Claudia
  [15/7/17, 11:20:19] Emily Phang: One person from each leadership group just send it to your respective chats

  [15/7/17, 22:31:18] Justin Lee: nope
  [15/7/17, 22:31:25] Justin Lee: a defunct 5yr old samsung
  [15/7/17, 22:31:39] Akash: Ok then I can only help with after effects
  [15/7/17, 22:31:43] Justin Lee: which is now incapable of running any software

  [15/7/17, 22:31:51] Justin Lee: oh lolz
  [15/7/17, 22:31:52] Akash: Oh
  [15/7/17, 22:34:10] Akash: Feedback Please
  [15/7/17, 22:44:45] Yi Hein: Woah nice, looks professional and quite a lot of effort put in 👍🏼, but I'm worried that the register might not fit
  [15/7/17, 22:45:45] Yi Hein: what do y'all think?
  [15/7/17, 22:45:57] Justin Lee: register?
  [15/7/17, 22:47:00] Jerome: Wanna add some Colours to the background?
  [15/7/17, 22:50:19] Yi Hein: as in whether the style is suitable for the occasion/situation
  [15/7/17, 22:51:06] Akash: the original was colour, but I made everything monochrome cuz having minimal colour and more shades will make the video look more professional
  [15/7/17, 22:51:14] Samuel Chang: Haha just washed it good job Akash it looks really professional and the background music is really jazzy
  [15/7/17, 22:51:20] Samuel Chang: I need to clarify some stuff tho
  [15/7/17, 22:51:21] Justin Lee: o:
  [15/7/17, 22:51:27] Akash: yup
  [15/7/17, 22:51:33] Akash: thanks man
  [15/7/17, 22:51:57] Samuel Chang: Like there's gonna be a section on heartfelt appreciation and all so how are u gonna link those tones
  [15/7/17, 22:51:58] Akash: we are playing it at the start so something cheerful to hype them up
  [15/7/17, 22:52:09] Samuel Chang: Maybe something for the whole team to think abt
  [15/7/17, 22:52:17] Akash: the appreciation video?
  [15/7/17, 22:52:24] Akash: like u mean the music?
  [15/7/17, 22:52:29] Samuel Chang: I think it's great but might be a bit confusing if we suddenly go to the emotional feeling part
  [15/7/17, 22:52:46] Samuel Chang: It's like the tone of this video is really hyped and eye catching
  [15/7/17, 22:52:56] Samuel Chang: But the appreciation part is like solemn and heartfelt
  [15/7/17, 22:52:56] claudia 🍏: I thought we are playing separate videos are separate times
  [15/7/17, 22:53:12] claudia 🍏: So the link part is not too crucial right
  [15/7/17, 22:53:13] Samuel Chang: Oh wait haha help me out here haha
  [15/7/17, 22:53:23] Samuel Chang: So this is gonna be played at the start
  [15/7/17, 22:53:39] Samuel Chang: Then the video is at a later timing when the dinner is a bit more settled
  [15/7/17, 22:53:39] claudia 🍏: Yo
  [15/7/17, 22:53:54] Samuel Chang: Ah I'm so sry haha
  [15/7/17, 22:54:04] Samuel Chang: Ok in that case good job link isn't crucial haha
  [15/7/17, 22:54:07] Samuel Chang: 👍🏻👍🏻
  [15/7/17, 22:54:46] Akash: lol Thanks m8
  [15/7/17, 22:54:59] Akash: Thanks for clarifying
  [15/7/17, 23:00:58] claudia 🍏: Oh shiz I just watched it
  [15/7/17, 23:01:01] claudia 🍏: It's pretty sick
  [15/7/17, 23:01:08] claudia 🍏: Thanks so much Akash 😩😩
  [15/7/17, 23:01:29] Akash: Youre welcome
  [15/7/17, 23:01:36] Akash: ayy Thanks
  [15/7/17, 23:02:03] Akash: also we need slides
  [15/7/17, 23:02:18] Akash: Can i design the slides?
  [15/7/17, 23:02:21] Emily Phang: Nice, thanks Akash!!!
  [15/7/17, 23:02:34] Akash: You're welcome
  [15/7/17, 23:28:01] claudia 🍏: Do we need slides though
  [15/7/17, 23:28:04] claudia 🍏: 🤔
  [15/7/17, 23:28:15] Akash: Yup
  [15/7/17, 23:37:03] claudia 🍏: Hahaha how come?
  [15/7/17, 23:37:09] claudia 🍏: I thought we just play the videos
  [15/7/17, 23:37:16] claudia 🍏: The acts don't need slides right 🤔
  [15/7/17, 23:46:51] Justin Lee: like we kinda need a background
  [15/7/17, 23:47:02] Justin Lee: during the acts and when there's no vid
  [15/7/17, 23:47:10] Akash: Yea
  [15/7/17, 23:47:17] Akash: Slides with just the act name
  [15/7/17, 23:47:23] Akash: Nothing else
  [16/7/17, 10:34:46] claudia 🍏: Oh yeah okay can can
  ‎[16/7/17, 12:33:15] Yi Hein: ‎image omitted
  [16/7/17, 12:36:33] Samuel Chang: I think it's ok
  [16/7/17, 12:36:36] Mannat: It looks nice But not too sure it will go with Colour scheme of the card thingy bc we are using dark red and blue and stuff
  [16/7/17, 12:37:06] Mannat: Ahhh if the rest think it's fine it should be fine !!!
  [16/7/17, 12:37:18] Samuel Chang: Haha I'm not that aesthetic so don't trust me HAHA
  [16/7/17, 12:37:46] Yi Hein: ^
  [16/7/17, 12:38:00] Yi Hein: I guess ok?
  [16/7/17, 12:38:11] Justin Lee: I think can
  [16/7/17, 12:38:12] evan tan: Nah the beads look really nah
  [16/7/17, 12:38:38] evan tan: And thats like more gold than light brown imo
  [16/7/17, 12:38:40] Samuel Chang: Haha rip
  [16/7/17, 12:39:21] Yi Hein: There's another guy trying to buy all the stock haha so need to decide now
  ‎[16/7/17, 12:40:33] Yi Hein: ‎image omitted
  [16/7/17, 12:41:07] Mannat: Wait did anyone already buy light brown frames.
  [16/7/17, 12:42:33] evan tan: we've been buying black frames only
  [16/7/17, 12:42:43] Yi Hein: Ok so stick to black
  [16/7/17, 12:42:48] evan tan: Yep
  [16/7/17, 12:42:52] Mannat: Yea
  [16/7/17, 12:42:54] evan tan: Standardise as far as possible
  [16/7/17, 12:42:57] evan tan: Thanks yi heing
  [16/7/17, 12:43:02] evan tan: Hein****
  [16/7/17, 12:45:14] Yi Hein: Ok I'll buy the 8 black ones I reserved
  [16/7/17, 12:47:36] Mannat: Also just wondering, how are we going to go about the writing on the cards... are we going to just get random juniors to write nice things or the juniors that actually know/have worked with them
  [16/7/17, 12:49:45] Justin Lee: I think so?
  [16/7/17, 12:56:23] Yi Hein: We do what they did for orientation, after school they can come to a classroom and write on the balloons, so they can choose who they wanna write to
  [16/7/17, 13:01:00] Mannat: Okayy thanks!!
  [16/7/17, 13:02:47] Yi Hein: HAHAHA apparently he said he's been going around branches and buying the frames...now we know where all the stock went 😂
  [16/7/17, 13:04:26] Yi Hein: ^^^
  [16/7/17, 13:34:47] Samuel Chang: For backdrop r we sticking with hanging paper?
  [16/7/17, 13:40:18] Akash: Has anyone contacted the MR teacher in charge to request for a guy to come down?
  [16/7/17, 13:40:27] Akash: If not I'll do it. Thanks
  [16/7/17, 14:09:24] evan tan: For our year, we are just passing the cards around one class at a time, rn we've done .03 and .05 i think. We're just getting anyone to write because theres a very low chance the seniors know ALOT of us anyways
  [16/7/17, 14:10:37] evan tan: For the prefects, we're probably gonna ask them to come down to the L room one day and write for the year 4s, although theres actually q a high possibility we may not be able to fill up all the balloons :/
  [16/7/17, 14:12:25] Justin Lee: I think prefects is possible
  [16/7/17, 14:12:35] Justin Lee: we usually fill up the bday cards relatively full
  [16/7/17, 14:13:17] Justin Lee: or right u can
  [16/7/17, 14:13:29] Justin Lee: using different handwriting write annoyomous msgs
  [16/7/17, 14:13:42] Justin Lee: to fill up everything
  [16/7/17, 14:13:44] Mannat: Maybe we can get a generic message from each of the Teachers to fill in those cards that's aren't fully filled
  [16/7/17, 14:14:19] Justin Lee: or u can use this more legit way
  [16/7/17, 14:19:02] evan tan: Mmm okay lets just hope we dont have to resort to that first HAHAHA

  1. We need to complete money collection *by the end of Monday* - please pass them to me (text me for whereabouts since I'm non-intact lol)
  
  2. We need to *fill all the balloons by the end of Monday* - for the PB, yall can ask the prefects to text them your messages and you write it for them so to expedite the process (keep going after them!!!). If there are any balloons left empty yall will have to fill it up with some standard stock messages on your own (‼️); but please only leave that as a last resort 😩
  
  3. We still need to buy frames, and this should be settled by the weekend xdxd. @6584988191 and @6582181659 you guys will be running down to Vivo and Tampines Daiso respectively right? 
  
  4. @Em and Jon, are y'all done collating the info from the performers, and are the skeleton emcee scripts ready? Doesn't have to be elaborate (in fact short is sweet) - once you're done, please create a group chat with Josh Amelia and I + email them the script (latest by Sunday night so that they have time to prep) 👀
  
  5. Evan can you email me the lettering by tomorrow night? 
  
  6. @video team, please remember to submit the three videos for vetting by 21/7 
  
  7. Please remind the student leaders in your respective boards to submit their speech script *before the end of today* (it's already 20/7 lol) but if they need an extension, please submit by 2359 on 22/7 
  
  8. Em and Jon please drop the emcee script (especially the names of each act) in the shared folder and Akash, please help to make the program slides! (Just the names of each act will do) 
  
  9. Yi Hein please share games program (including the list of questions + pictures you want to use) with Akash so that he can make the program slides. Alternatively you can make the games slides on your own (since you'll know the flow better) and then share it with Akash, and Akash incorporates it to the rest of program slides xd

  11. We should complete and get ready all program related matters by Tuesday 25/7 👀 This includes the *three videos*, the *program slides*, the emcee scriptand the *prizes* for the games (Justin you'll need to collate and wrap by Thursday and leave it in the L room). 
  
  12. Can we have two people in charge of buying the stuff on the logs list? This includes the gold and white balloons (Party City HV, but check prices first), post-its and 1 roll of duct tape 🤑 Please let the group know if you're going to buy
  
  13. Everyone, especially those heading down to Daiso, please keep a look out for cheap paper bags that can store each frame (for them to carry home conveniently)

Like $12 for one small pack of gold and silver rip... Should we just buy those cheap ones (with like pink and all that lol) from NTUC or scrap the floor balloons idea?
  [22/7/17, 19:31:12] claudia 🍏: How about a wrapped up broccoli
  [22/7/17, 19:42:02] Justin Lee: omt

I know we faced 101 obstacles but u guys were resourceful with the photo booth, the venue deco and the gift ideas.  I know I wasn't the most present of exco attaches and kind of regret but I'm super proud to see u guys pulling this off. Especially for most of you Monday will be your first investiture into ACS leadership so it's im super  excited to see that happen! Hope to work with u guys again and once again fantastic job couldn't have asked for a better effort and team spirit!

  [27/11/16, 21:53:13] Donovan Sim: No problem
  [27/11/16, 21:53:32] Yi Hein: Btw are the selection for EXCO separate from the voting process?
  [27/11/16, 21:54:03] Donovan Sim: Yes

  [21/12/16, 23:27:18] Donovan Sim: Hey Yi Hein
  [21/12/16, 23:27:28] Donovan Sim: Not sure if you still have the chance
  [21/12/16, 23:27:41] Donovan Sim: But I suggest you go for at least one model un conference
  [21/12/16, 23:27:57] Donovan Sim: It will help with the situational test and exco selection
  [22/12/16, 00:53:55] Yi Hein: Yeah, sounds like a great idea since my speaking skills isn't exactly great.
  [22/12/16, 00:54:06] Donovan Sim: it's not so much about speaking skills
  [22/12/16, 00:54:10] Donovan Sim: it's about dominating the conversation
  [22/12/16, 00:54:15] Donovan Sim: leading the direction of debate
  [22/12/16, 00:54:17] Donovan Sim: coming up with ideas
  [22/12/16, 00:54:26] Donovan Sim: but yes this does help a lot
  [22/12/16, 00:54:30] Yi Hein: Oh I see
  [22/12/16, 00:54:33] Yi Hein: But are non YDS people allowed to join
  [22/12/16, 00:54:46] Donovan Sim: join yds
  [22/12/16, 00:54:50] Donovan Sim: what could go wrong
  [22/12/16, 00:54:52] Donovan Sim: it's really flexible
  [22/12/16, 00:54:57] Donovan Sim: you only go for muns you want to go for
  [22/12/16, 00:55:06] Donovan Sim: and training is 'ponnable' if you play your cards right
  [22/12/16, 00:55:41] Yi Hein: So applying for MUNs can only be done through the school?
  [22/12/16, 00:55:49] Donovan Sim: done through yds
  [22/12/16, 00:55:55] Donovan Sim: or if you do it independently, don't get caught
  [22/12/16, 00:56:06] Donovan Sim: if you do get caught, tell them "i didn't know"
  [22/12/16, 00:56:16] Donovan Sim: didn't know about the rule that you have to go through yds
  [22/12/16, 00:56:49] Yi Hein: May I know who should I speak to, to join YDS?
  [22/12/16, 00:57:05] Donovan Sim: let me think
  [22/12/16, 00:57:21] Donovan Sim: what ug are you?
  [22/12/16, 00:57:35] Yi Hein: St Johns
  [22/12/16, 00:57:48] Donovan Sim: do you know pradeep?
  [22/12/16, 00:58:09] Yi Hein: No, but I know quite a few friends in YDS though
  [22/12/16, 00:58:23] Donovan Sim: well
  [22/12/16, 00:58:36] Donovan Sim: it makes more strategic sense to approach the comps or training directors
  [22/12/16, 00:58:41] Donovan Sim: or someone you already know in exco
  ‎[22/12/16, 00:59:06] Donovan Sim: ‎Contact card omitted
  [22/12/16, 00:59:14] Donovan Sim: he's a trianing director
  [22/12/16, 00:59:20] Yi Hein: Joining YDS needs to go through Teachers right?
  [22/12/16, 00:59:34] Donovan Sim: no
  [22/12/16, 00:59:46] Donovan Sim: unless you drop track and use yds as your 2nd cca instead of your 3rd
  [22/12/16, 01:00:14] Yi Hein: Oh I see
  [22/12/16, 01:00:26] Donovan Sim: actually
  [22/12/16, 01:00:45] Donovan Sim: okay never mind
  [22/12/16, 01:00:46] Donovan Sim: ignore that
  [22/12/16, 01:00:51] Donovan Sim: i forgot about their new regulation
  [22/12/16, 01:00:55] Donovan Sim: just contact pradeep
  [22/12/16, 01:01:05] Donovan Sim: see what competitions are coming up
  [22/12/16, 01:01:09] Yi Hein: Ok thanks for the suggestion, I'll message him
  [22/12/16, 01:01:12] Donovan Sim: so far I think I only know scmun
  [22/12/16, 01:01:17] Donovan Sim: in march or so
  [22/12/16, 01:01:45] Yi Hein: I'm only back during Christmas so I'll try to find a MUN next year
  [22/12/16, 01:01:58] Donovan Sim: well
  [22/12/16, 01:02:04] Donovan Sim: there are no more muns for the rest of the year anyway
  [22/12/16, 01:02:42] Yi Hein: Yeah, I heard some of my friends just finished a MUN
  [22/12/16, 01:02:49] Donovan Sim: unasmun
  [22/12/16, 01:03:06] Donovan Sim: on hindsight should have told you about it earlier

  [22/12/16, 01:03:19] Donovan Sim: but oh well

  [22/12/16, 01:04:15] Yi Hein: May I know roughly when's the situational test?
  [22/12/16, 01:04:23] Donovan Sim: march?
  [22/12/16, 01:04:47] Donovan Sim: while you're still overseas, may want to think about your wardrobe
  [22/12/16, 01:04:51] Donovan Sim: and your 'bros'
  [22/12/16, 01:04:59] Donovan Sim: whatever you do don't dress pretentiously
  [22/12/16, 01:05:18] Donovan Sim: and retain good relations with your friends from y4ip
  [22/12/16, 01:05:32] Yi Hein: Ok
  [22/12/16, 01:05:45] Donovan Sim: if you go gym, don't make it look like you're doing it for the girls

  [16/1/17, 20:43:47] Yi Hein: Other than creating facebook pages/instagram accounts, how do you garner support and convince others to vote for you?
  [16/1/17, 20:44:00] Yi Hein: Like how do you stand out from others
  [1/2/17, 10:21:34] Donovan Sim: Oh sorry I missed this
  [1/2/17, 10:21:39] Donovan Sim: Like i said
  [1/2/17, 10:21:43] Donovan Sim: Sincerity
  [1/2/17, 10:22:20] Donovan Sim: Facebook and ig pages are only meant to sway people who need one more vote to meet the minimum required number of votes
  [1/2/17, 10:22:28] Donovan Sim: Ultinately its all about the number of people you know
  [1/2/17, 10:22:38] Donovan Sim: And the number of people you know that think you're sincere
  [1/2/17, 10:22:54] Donovan Sim: On the other hand they may also vote for you for the lols if you're funny/a joke
  [1/2/17, 10:23:05] Donovan Sim: But i think the former is the more legit strategy
  [1/2/17, 10:23:15] Donovan Sim: That being said
  [1/2/17, 10:23:25] Donovan Sim: I didn't get in because i actually new alot of people
  [1/2/17, 10:23:33] Donovan Sim: But because i made a good impression on some seniors
  [1/2/17, 10:23:42] Donovan Sim: Who then helped campaign for me on my behalf
  [1/2/17, 10:23:59] Donovan Sim: So that's one way to do it without knowing a lot of people
  [1/2/17, 10:24:06] Donovan Sim: But it may be too late at this point
  [1/2/17, 10:24:19] Donovan Sim: Above all don't appear pretentious
  [1/2/17, 10:24:44] Yi Hein: Alright
  [1/2/17, 10:25:20] Yi Hein: By sincerity you mean being sincere about doing something for the school while in council?
  [1/2/17, 10:25:50] Donovan Sim: I mean make people think that you want to get in for selfless reasons
  [1/2/17, 10:25:56] Donovan Sim: And not because of popularity or cv etc
  [1/2/17, 10:26:14] Yi Hein: Ok I see
  [1/2/17, 10:26:52] Donovan Sim: When school reopens
  [1/2/17, 10:27:18] Donovan Sim: I suggest you try to make friends with a pops girl who plans on running for council amd is likely to reach the campaigning stage
  [1/2/17, 10:27:26] Donovan Sim: One is pretty much all you need
  [1/2/17, 10:27:31] Donovan Sim: On the other hand
  [1/2/17, 10:27:42] Donovan Sim: There are successful campaigning teams thatvget in without any gurls
  [1/2/17, 10:29:01] Yi Hein: Any other tips on team forming? Is it better to form teams with people you know or people that are popular
  [1/2/17, 10:29:21] Donovan Sim: Actually you want to talk over the phone?
  [1/2/17, 10:29:29] Yi Hein: Yeah sure
  [1/2/17, 10:30:11] Donovan Sim: ‎Missed voice call
  [1/2/17, 10:30:21] Yi Hein: Let me try again
  [1/2/17, 10:30:45] Donovan Sim: ‎Missed voice call
  [1/2/17, 10:30:52] Yi Hein: It's not connecting
  [1/2/17, 10:30:58] Yi Hein: Do you mind a normal call?
  [4/2/17, 17:08:04] Yi Hein: Hey Donovan, do you know anything about "Student Leader Corps"?
  [4/2/17, 17:08:12] Yi Hein: I just received an invitation
  [4/2/17, 17:08:35] Donovan Sim: No, sorry, I don't
  [4/2/17, 17:09:00] Yi Hein: Oh okay, apparently it's tied to the UGs
  [4/2/17, 17:09:13] Donovan Sim: like
  [4/2/17, 17:09:17] Donovan Sim: is it within our school?
  [4/2/17, 17:09:24] Yi Hein: Yeah
  [4/2/17, 17:11:03] Donovan Sim: wait
  [4/2/17, 17:11:10] Donovan Sim: so they invited you to join?
  [4/2/17, 17:11:16] Yi Hein: Yeah
  [4/2/17, 17:11:26] Donovan Sim: okay
  [4/2/17, 17:11:29] Donovan Sim: then join it I guess
  [12/2/17, 11:14:54] Yi Hein: Hey Don, do you have other campaign examples from last year? Or the previous year?
  [12/2/17, 11:15:18] Donovan Sim: Search 'for council' on Facebook
  [12/2/17, 11:15:39] Donovan Sim: All the campaign ig pages are tagged in team_aced's picture
  [12/2/17, 11:15:48] Donovan Sim: For last year's campaigns i mean
  [12/2/17, 11:16:39] Donovan Sim: For now id say don't worry too much about campaigning
  [12/2/17, 11:16:47] Donovan Sim: Other than the people you are going to campaign with
  [12/2/17, 11:17:22] Yi Hein: Ok, the only tags I see in team_aced are their team members
  ‎[12/2/17, 11:18:20] Donovan Sim: ‎image omitted
  [12/2/17, 12:30:26] Yi Hein: Ah I see thanks
  [16/2/17, 14:24:50] Yi Hein: Hey Donovan, you're overseeing SLC now?
  [16/2/17, 14:43:28] Donovan Sim: Yes
  [16/2/17, 14:43:30] Donovan Sim: I'm an advisor
  [16/2/17, 21:17:01] Donovan Sim: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzDkRkPg7KrFbmdDNElaQV9UQlk/view
  [16/2/17, 21:29:13] Donovan Sim: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzDkRkPg7KrFbmdDNElaQV9UQlk/view?usp=sharing
  [17/2/17, 05:53:49] Yi Hein: Thanks for sending this early
  [17/2/17, 05:54:20] Yi Hein: Application form looks almost identical to that of the house captain's application form
  [17/2/17, 05:54:54] Yi Hein: I suppose the situational test is incorporated into the selection camp?
  [17/2/17, 06:31:26] Donovan Sim: Yes
  [19/2/17, 23:18:41] Donovan Sim: Hey man
  [19/2/17, 23:18:43] Donovan Sim: just wondering
  [19/2/17, 23:18:46] Donovan Sim: what's your role in slc?
  [19/2/17, 23:19:16] Yi Hein: I'm an NCO from St Johns who is interested about SLC
  [19/2/17, 23:19:26] Donovan Sim: cool
  [19/2/17, 23:41:38] Donovan Sim: nice one man
  [19/2/17, 23:41:42] Donovan Sim: diffusing the situation
  [19/2/17, 23:41:59] Donovan Sim: I think that's some 'legit points" in your favour
  [19/2/17, 23:42:16] Donovan Sim: tbh i think you're handling the situation well
  [19/2/17, 23:42:21] Donovan Sim: not getting involved in the nasty politics
  [19/2/17, 23:42:29] Donovan Sim: The contrast will sorta set you apart
  [19/2/17, 23:42:57] Yi Hein: Haha i was just trying to calm things down
  [19/2/17, 23:43:05] Donovan Sim: its good
  [19/2/17, 23:43:09] Yi Hein: I believe in leadership through friendship and trust
  [19/2/17, 23:43:12] Donovan Sim: unlike the rest, you don't seem like a cock haha
  [19/2/17, 23:43:29] Yi Hein: 😂
  [19/2/17, 23:43:40] Donovan Sim: DUNT TELL THEM I SAID THAT AH
  [19/2/17, 23:44:01] Yi Hein: My lips are sealed haha
  [19/2/17, 23:44:16] Donovan Sim: How's progress?
  [19/2/17, 23:44:18] Donovan Sim: made more friends?
  [19/2/17, 23:45:52] Yi Hein: I know a lot a people
  [19/2/17, 23:45:59] Yi Hein: Just not really that well
  [19/2/17, 23:46:01] Donovan Sim: yesss
  [19/2/17, 23:46:02] Donovan Sim: that's good
  [19/2/17, 23:46:06] Donovan Sim: never mind its a start
  [19/2/17, 23:46:10] Yi Hein: It takes time to really know them
  [19/2/17, 23:46:26] Donovan Sim: if it isn't weird within the context of your personality, make sure you always say hi when you pass them by
  [19/2/17, 23:46:39] Yi Hein: Yup
  [19/2/17, 23:46:39] Donovan Sim: like it's been established that i'm eccentric, right?
  [19/2/17, 23:46:40] Donovan Sim: so like
  [19/2/17, 23:46:41] Donovan Sim: when I pass by
  [19/2/17, 23:46:48] Donovan Sim: it's okay for me to say hi to people i don't know
  [19/2/17, 23:46:54] Donovan Sim: and to say weird stuff like
  [19/2/17, 23:46:58] Donovan Sim: "looking handsome today"
  [19/2/17, 23:47:00] Donovan Sim: "looking tall"
  [19/2/17, 23:47:10] Donovan Sim: or just holding up a hand to the side of my face and ignoring them
  [19/2/17, 23:47:12] Donovan Sim: or dabbing them
  [19/2/17, 23:47:17] Donovan Sim: basically
  [19/2/17, 23:47:24] Donovan Sim: do something that will make them laugh
  [19/2/17, 23:47:34] Donovan Sim: or bring you attention (without looking pretentious)
  [19/2/17, 23:47:45] Donovan Sim: or something that will give the two of you something to talk about
  [19/2/17, 23:48:05] Donovan Sim: just stay within the limits of what public perception of your personality allows
  [19/2/17, 23:48:11] Yi Hein: Haha yeah, you come across as a cool kid 😎
  [19/2/17, 23:48:17] Yi Hein: Yup I'll try my best
  [19/2/17, 23:48:20] Donovan Sim: nononono
  [19/2/17, 23:48:24] Donovan Sim: no
  [19/2/17, 23:48:25] Donovan Sim: i'm not cool
  [19/2/17, 23:48:28] Donovan Sim: theres a difference
  [19/2/17, 23:48:38] Donovan Sim: i'm known as the weird/eccentric/funny guy
  [19/2/17, 23:48:39] Yi Hein: Not cool as in POP
  [19/2/17, 23:48:43] Donovan Sim: depending on who it is
  [19/2/17, 23:48:47] Yi Hein: Yeah eccentric
  [19/2/17, 23:49:11] Yi Hein: Chat tmr? need to catch some 😴
  [19/2/17, 23:49:20] Donovan Sim: sure
  [19/2/17, 23:49:21] Donovan Sim: rest well
  [19/2/17, 23:49:23] Donovan Sim: all the best!
  [19/2/17, 23:49:27] Yi Hein: You too
  [19/2/17, 23:49:31] Yi Hein: Thanks!
  [19/2/17, 23:49:34] Donovan Sim: Thanks
  [20/2/17, 05:42:08] Yi Hein: Y'all advocate open communication and hide behind the shield of political correctness and silent dissing, nothing's ever gonna work out the way you want it to. 
  
  Want open communication, maybe you wanna try being open? And communicating. I don't see either. 
  
  Tip of the day: This works better in person.
  [20/2/17, 05:42:21] Yi Hein: Just read the message from the group
  [20/2/17, 05:42:41] Yi Hein: Life's gonna give you lemons but you're gonna have to eat it
  [20/2/17, 06:21:06] Donovan Sim: Yea
  [20/2/17, 06:46:23] Yi Hein: " I'm actually really good friends with many of the people in this group, so that's why I'm more friendly with them"
  [20/2/17, 06:46:50] Yi Hein: Omg Donovan, I hope I didn't accidentally backstab you
  [20/2/17, 06:51:15] Donovan Sim: Haha no lah
  [20/2/17, 06:51:24] Donovan Sim: How would you have backstabbed me
  [20/2/17, 06:53:24] Yi Hein: Exposed that we are some connection
  [20/2/17, 06:53:31] Yi Hein: *have
  [20/2/17, 06:53:39] Donovan Sim: Really meh
  [20/2/17, 06:53:42] Yi Hein: I hope no one notices
  [20/2/17, 06:55:41] Donovan Sim: Lmao no lah
  [20/2/17, 06:55:52] Donovan Sim: We've mever directly adressed each other in the group anyway
  [22/2/17, 19:24:32] Yi Hein: Hey Donovan you know who were the people in the conversation, perhaps I could get a better understanding of the context
  [22/2/17, 23:54:50] Donovan Sim: Keith ho
  [22/2/17, 23:54:54] Donovan Sim: One primer
  [22/2/17, 23:54:58] Donovan Sim: I don't know the last guy
  [22/2/17, 23:55:05] Donovan Sim: Keith ho made the bulk of statements
  [23/2/17, 06:04:46] Yi Hein: Oh keith
  [23/2/17, 06:05:26] Yi Hein: Perhaps I should be more wary about how I portray myself
  [23/2/17, 06:09:52] Yi Hein: Btw what CCAs are you in?
  [23/2/17, 06:22:00] Donovan Sim: Council
  [23/2/17, 06:22:02] Donovan Sim: Primers
  [23/2/17, 06:22:03] Donovan Sim: Yds
  [23/2/17, 06:22:04] Donovan Sim: Cf
  [23/2/17, 06:22:59] Yi Hein: Ah I see
  [23/2/17, 06:23:17] Yi Hein: My CCAs are quite screwed up right now
  [23/2/17, 06:24:07] Yi Hein: I just got rejected for interact, St. John NYAA had some Organising problems
  [23/2/17, 06:24:29] Yi Hein: And probably not gonna get house Cap cause Micheal Lee is sucking up to the house manager
  [23/2/17, 06:24:45] Donovan Sim: Then suck up harder
  [23/2/17, 06:25:00] Donovan Sim: Casually walk past her more often
  [23/2/17, 06:25:03] Donovan Sim: Make conversation
  [23/2/17, 06:25:07] Donovan Sim: Ask her how her day was
  [23/2/17, 06:25:28] Yi Hein: Oh my house manager is Cao Hui zong
  [23/2/17, 06:25:45] Donovan Sim: Oh
  [23/2/17, 06:25:50] Yi Hein: Like basically he is telling to do Micheal to do all the house admin work already
  [23/2/17, 06:25:58] Donovan Sim: Oh
  [24/2/17, 22:38:21] Yi Hein: Hey Donovan, my mentor is Audrey
  [25/2/17, 13:12:34] Donovan Sim: Okay
  [25/2/17, 13:12:41] Donovan Sim: Perhaps strike up a convo about music?
  [25/2/17, 13:12:43] Donovan Sim: She sings well
  [25/2/17, 13:12:51] Donovan Sim: She's very pro at violin
  [25/2/17, 13:14:13] Yi Hein: Well I've little interest in music so I don't think that'll work well
  [25/2/17, 13:14:22] Yi Hein: What's her personality like
  [25/2/17, 13:16:15] Donovan Sim: She's very nice
  [25/2/17, 13:16:30] Donovan Sim: Nothing more I can say
  [25/2/17, 13:16:37] Donovan Sim: Shouldn't be hard to start a convo with her
  [25/2/17, 13:16:45] Donovan Sim: She's in softball
  [25/2/17, 13:16:51] Donovan Sim: Perhaps you could talk about that?
  [25/2/17, 13:17:00] Donovan Sim: I think she has a beother and at least one sister
  [25/2/17, 13:17:06] Donovan Sim: Perhaps you could talk about family
  [25/2/17, 13:17:33] Donovan Sim: Oh yea she's also the only music ee student who doesn't take hl music
  [25/2/17, 13:17:43] Donovan Sim: So you could start askin her about how to decide ee etc
  [25/2/17, 13:17:59] Donovan Sim: And then she may bring up this interesting point
  [25/2/17, 13:18:09] Donovan Sim: Then just keep the convo going
  [25/2/17, 13:18:44] Donovan Sim: Of you know what you could just ask her about council
  [25/2/17, 13:18:50] Donovan Sim: Ask her about the community
  [25/2/17, 13:18:52] Donovan Sim: Personalities
  [25/2/17, 13:18:53] Donovan Sim: Etc
  [26/3/17, 17:11:30] Yi Hein: Woah I just saw the name list of council applicants
  [26/3/17, 17:11:41] Donovan Sim: Yea
  [26/3/17, 17:11:48] Yi Hein: It's not gonna be a walk in the park to get past the camp
  [26/3/17, 17:11:55] Yi Hein: Sooo many people
  [26/3/17, 17:12:06] Donovan Sim: Of course it aint
  [26/3/17, 17:12:13] Donovan Sim: That's why i told you to prepare
  [26/3/17, 17:12:54] Yi Hein: Yeah I feel quite lucky cause being Vice-Chair gives quite a lot of opportunities to practice the leadership model you mentioned
  [26/3/17, 17:14:17] Yi Hein: But I feel sometimes it'll come in naturally, like I'm following the model without realising it
  [26/3/17, 17:15:41] Donovan Sim: That's good
  [26/3/17, 17:16:01] Yi Hein: Btw, is the situational test planning based (like the house cap test), or a paper answer sheet
  [26/3/17, 17:16:15] Yi Hein: Or is it like a speech you mentioned before
  [26/3/17, 18:18:55] Donovan Sim: There's really no method imo
  [26/3/17, 18:18:58] Donovan Sim: Just go all out
  [26/3/17, 18:19:11] Donovan Sim: Skills like this can't really be learnt
  [26/3/17, 18:19:14] Yi Hein: Haha ok
  [26/3/17, 18:19:20] Donovan Sim: But I don't know i might be wrong
  [26/3/17, 18:20:03] Yi Hein: I'll continue to get to know more people haha
  [26/3/17, 18:20:11] Donovan Sim: Good
  [26/3/17, 18:20:36] Donovan Sim: Knowing people will also help. Increases probability of ending up in same assessment camp group
  [26/3/17, 18:20:43] Donovan Sim: Which can arguably be advantageous
  [26/3/17, 18:21:07] Yi Hein: Ah yeah
  [26/3/17, 18:21:56] Yi Hein: For my campaigning I've mainly focused on getting to know people who aren't pop and are just quite neutral
  [26/3/17, 18:22:18] Yi Hein: I hope my strategy is right but not knowing POP kids can be disadvantageous too
  [26/3/17, 18:22:26] Donovan Sim: Well it doesn't really matter who yor voters are
  [26/3/17, 18:22:30] Donovan Sim: Just as long as they vote for you
  [26/3/17, 18:22:55] Yi Hein: Okie
  [26/3/17, 18:23:07] Yi Hein: I'm quite fortunate actually cause I'm the only one in my class applying for council
  [26/3/17, 18:23:17] Donovan Sim: GOOD
  [26/3/17, 18:23:27] Yi Hein: Hahaha they said they'll vote for me so it Guess it's a good start
  [26/3/17, 18:23:30] Donovan Sim: make sure you convince as many classmates to vote for you as possible
  [26/3/17, 18:23:36] Donovan Sim: Yup
  [26/3/17, 18:23:48] Donovan Sim: And there's no meed to "share the love" either
  [26/3/17, 18:23:57] Yi Hein: Hahaha yeah
  [26/3/17, 18:24:00] Donovan Sim: My class had 5 people
  [26/3/17, 18:24:03] Donovan Sim: Out of 22.....
  [26/3/17, 18:24:33] Yi Hein: Oh my class is ASP so everyone is so mugger and didn't bother about council
  [26/3/17, 18:24:47] Yi Hein: I Guess it's a blessing in disguise
  [26/3/17, 18:24:54] Donovan Sim: Yea
  [30/3/17, 20:02:59] Donovan Sim: Hey
  [30/3/17, 20:02:59] Donovan Sim: Rest well and get ready for tomorrow. Any questions can ask me (though of course I can't tell you stuff like what's going to come out for the assessment etcetc). If you're feeling nervous, I can empathise with you, because this time last year I was 60 percent convinced I wouldn't be able to get through the first round.
  [30/3/17, 20:03:00] Donovan Sim: All the best.
  [30/3/17, 20:14:17] Yi Hein: Thanks man
  [30/3/17, 20:14:58] Yi Hein: I'm going to give it my all while trying to be chill haha
  [30/3/17, 20:15:08] Donovan Sim: Good
  [30/3/17, 20:15:12] Donovan Sim: Make me proud.
  [30/3/17, 20:15:18] Donovan Sim: This is already what
  [30/3/17, 20:15:20] Yi Hein: But yeah it's really going to be hard
  [30/3/17, 20:15:22] Donovan Sim: 4-5 months in preperation
  [30/3/17, 20:15:27] Donovan Sim: Don't let all that effort go to waste
  [30/3/17, 20:15:50] Yi Hein: Alright :) thanks for your advice so far!
  [30/3/17, 20:15:59] Donovan Sim: Welcome
  [31/3/17, 18:04:13] Donovan Sim: How was today?
  [31/3/17, 18:09:48] Yi Hein: Today is only the test in the LT
  [31/3/17, 18:10:56] Yi Hein: It's pretty okay, tomorrow's the sit test
  [31/3/17, 18:12:30] Yi Hein: So majority of leadership skills interaction with others, teamwork etc. will be for tomorrow so  hopefully I'm preped for that
  [31/3/17, 18:13:19] Yi Hein: The sit test was so troll LMAO, "act like you are busy, so others will continue reading the tasks"
  [31/3/17, 18:24:22] Donovan Sim: Hahahhaha

  [15/4/17, 22:55:25] Yi Hein: I've thought about it and rewrote my intro statement as truthfully as I can
  [15/4/17, 22:55:30] Yi Hein: Hey guys! I’m Yi Hein (#55) and my CCAs are Cross Country, St. John’s, YDS. As much as I would like to, I can’t say my journey in AC has been a smooth sailing and perfect one. While I’ve experienced various successes in my 4 years in AC, each success lies countless times of failures and disappointments. And the reality is that no matter what we do, we will meet trials and tribulations, and some of which that threaten to overwhelm us. Today, I am immensely grateful to be nominated for campaigning phase, and the reason I able to stand here as a nominee is only because of the support and encouragement YOU, the AC community has given me during my toughest times. The AC family spirit have allowed me to stand up no matter how many times I’ve fallen down, for which I am truly thankful for. 
  
  Today, it’s my turn to give back to this very community. I lead through friendship and mutual trust, and it is on these values that I hope to continue building on AC’s caring and encouraging community, and ultimately to allow us to be there for those who needs us most. Hence, please help me and my team fulfil our vision, by voting us for the Student Council!
  [15/4/17, 22:55:36] Yi Hein: Whatcha think?
  [16/4/17, 23:26:04] Yi Hein: Do you think it's a good idea to ask my Friends to publicise for me?
  [16/4/17, 23:26:24] Donovan Sim: Oh yes
  [16/4/17, 23:26:29] Donovan Sim: okay regarding your statement above
  [16/4/17, 23:26:48] Donovan Sim: perhaps lose the second paragraph
  [16/4/17, 23:26:49] Donovan Sim: idk
  [16/4/17, 23:26:53] Donovan Sim: i'm not sure how your cohort will take it
  [16/4/17, 23:26:55] Donovan Sim: in essence
  [16/4/17, 23:27:09] Donovan Sim: just remove all the parts that would make people think "xian. This again."
  [16/4/17, 23:27:20] Donovan Sim: "Xian. Just another guy sucking up to me to get votes for council"
  [16/4/17, 23:27:45] Donovan Sim: Remember that this takes up "favour points". If you are sure that doing this won't make them xian and not vote for you anymore, then go ahead
  [16/4/17, 23:28:00] Donovan Sim: essentailly, don't put people off by asking them to publicise for you
  [16/4/17, 23:28:13] Yi Hein: Ah ok
  [16/4/17, 23:28:52] Yi Hein: Oh yeah and for Insta post we're planning to put a post up once every 1-2 hours is that fine?
  [16/4/17, 23:38:41] Donovan Sim: it's up to you
  [16/4/17, 23:38:48] Donovan Sim: just make sure 1. it isn't too obnoxious
  [16/4/17, 23:38:54] Donovan Sim: 2. as many people as possible see it
  [16/4/17, 23:42:27] Yi Hein: ok thanks!
  [16/4/17, 23:57:23] Donovan Sim: Welcome
  [16/4/17, 23:57:25] Donovan Sim: All the best

  [25/4/17, 21:11:09] Donovan Sim: He'll give you a unique perspective of council
  [25/4/17, 21:11:42] Yi Hein: Unique as in good or bad?
  [25/4/17, 21:12:05] Donovan Sim: Different
  [25/4/17, 21:12:19] Yi Hein: Ah I see
  [25/4/17, 21:12:55] Yi Hein: Hahaha everyone (including Ben) said I'm unlucky to get him as my mentor
  [25/4/17, 21:13:26] Yi Hein: I thought he was quite legit considering he was like head prefect in Y4?
  [25/4/17, 21:13:56] Donovan Sim: Lmao
  [25/4/17, 21:14:12] Donovan Sim: Oh well
  [25/4/17, 21:17:07] Yi Hein: But how's he like as a person though?

  [7/8/17, 20:22:35] Donovan Sim: can't think of anything else
  [7/8/17, 20:27:42] Yi Hein: Hmmm do you happen to have their contact?

  [18/1/19, 16:19:38] Donovan Sim: If you don’t sign its like
  [18/1/19, 16:19:45] Donovan Sim: A 10 percent chance?
  [18/1/19, 16:19:46] Donovan Sim: Maybe lower
  [18/1/19, 16:19:50] Donovan Sim: Never mind just sign first
  [18/1/19, 16:19:56] Donovan Sim: Make up your mind later
  [18/1/19, 16:20:12] Donovan Sim: I call you?
  [18/1/19, 16:20:17] Yi Hein: Can can
  [14/2/19, 22:21:07] Yi Hein: Hey Donovan, got any tips for field camp and sit test
  [14/2/19, 23:00:01] Donovan Sim: Can i call you
  [15/2/19, 04:35:32] Yi Hein: Soz lights out already
  [15/2/19, 04:35:35] Yi Hein: Now can
  [15/2/19, 06:13:20] Donovan Sim: Field camp sit test is not my strength all i can say is doN’t wayang at all costs
  [15/2/19, 12:07:33] Yi Hein: Wayang as in be enthu?
  [15/2/19, 12:08:21] Donovan Sim: Don’t come off as insincere
  [15/2/19, 12:08:22] Donovan Sim: Like
  [15/2/19, 12:08:36] Donovan Sim: Don’t make it look like you only care about yourself and only care about going ocs
  [15/2/19, 12:08:42] Donovan Sim: Be someone that people like
  [15/2/19, 12:08:49] Donovan Sim: Like just ask yourself
  [15/2/19, 12:08:57] Donovan Sim: Which of your sectionmates is most popular?
  [15/2/19, 12:08:59] Donovan Sim: And why?
  [15/2/19, 12:09:09] Donovan Sim: Its probably not the one who is trying to chiong for ocs right
  [15/2/19, 12:09:58] Yi Hein: Well he's made it clear he's going for OCS
  [15/2/19, 12:10:11] Yi Hein: but yeah he's likeable
  [15/2/19, 12:10:54] Yi Hein: On TOP of being likeable, have to demonstrate that I'm capable too right?
  [15/2/19, 12:14:41] Donovan Sim: hmm
  [15/2/19, 12:14:45] Donovan Sim: yes to a certain extent
  [15/2/19, 12:14:52] Donovan Sim: but i think the most important thing is being likeable
  [15/2/19, 12:14:57] Donovan Sim: because it carries the most weightage i think
  [15/2/19, 12:14:58] Donovan Sim: oh and btw
  [15/2/19, 12:15:08] Donovan Sim: likeable isn't just people think you're a good friend
  [15/2/19, 12:15:16] Donovan Sim: i think the three criteria that people will grade you on are
  [15/2/19, 12:15:17] Donovan Sim: preferred friend
  [15/2/19, 12:15:18] Donovan Sim: leadership
  [15/2/19, 12:15:20] Donovan Sim: responsibility
  [15/2/19, 12:15:29] Donovan Sim: i remember preferred friend definitely can't quite remember the other two
  [15/2/19, 12:15:48] Donovan Sim: hmm okay then
  [15/2/19, 12:15:53] Donovan Sim: but you watch ah boys to men right
  [15/2/19, 12:15:56] Donovan Sim: don't be aloysius
  [15/2/19, 12:16:01] Donovan Sim: that's what i'm trying to say
  [15/2/19, 13:35:47] Yi Hein: Ok thanks hopefully it's goes fine tmr
  [15/2/19, 13:36:15] Donovan Sim: All the best
  [15/2/19, 13:36:26] Donovan Sim: Every ACSian a Scholar, Officer, and Gentleman.
  [15/2/19, 13:36:51] Donovan Sim: It doesn’t mean anything if you can’t get to OCS
  [15/2/19, 13:37:01] Donovan Sim: (Unless you want to sign on)
  [15/2/19, 13:39:36] Yi Hein: Hahaha yeah
  [15/2/19, 13:47:03] Yi Hein: Btw any tips on confident in speaking? It's one of my key weaknesses and I think it impacts my performance quite a bit
  [15/2/19, 13:47:40] Donovan Sim: Oh the way i think about it is like when you are discussing with your friends where to go dinner
  [15/2/19, 13:47:51] Donovan Sim: And especialy for chaotic high stress environment less is more
  [15/2/19, 13:47:59] Donovan Sim: Pick out only the most important points
  [15/2/19, 13:48:12] Donovan Sim: If you talk too long all your words will go in one ear cone out the other
  [15/2/19, 13:48:45] Yi Hein: Yeah that's true
  [15/2/19, 13:49:06] Donovan Sim: Yea they drilled this into us a lot at navy ocs
  [15/2/19, 13:50:25] Yi Hein: Hmmm how do you get ppl's attention so that they'll listen to what I'm saying
  [15/2/19, 13:52:38] Donovan Sim: Hmm I’m not an expert but if your voice is loud it helps or if you point out something smart
  [15/2/19, 18:38:34] Donovan Sim: Oh yea!
  [15/2/19, 18:38:38] Donovan Sim: I learned this in navy
  [15/2/19, 18:38:41] Donovan Sim: SAI
  [15/2/19, 18:38:43] Donovan Sim: Situation
  [15/2/19, 18:38:45] Donovan Sim: Assessment
  [15/2/19, 18:38:47] Donovan Sim: Intention
  [15/2/19, 18:38:50] Donovan Sim: So for example
  [15/2/19, 18:39:25] Donovan Sim: S- we have a casualty and an enemy tank is approachinng within the next 60 seconds
  [15/2/19, 18:39:44] Donovan Sim: A- we won’t be able to run away from the tank while carrying the casualty
  [15/2/19, 18:40:07] Donovan Sim: I- Whole squad conceal yourselves, hide between bushes and trees with casualty
  [15/2/19, 18:40:10] Donovan Sim: Somethingn like that
  [15/2/19, 18:40:19] Donovan Sim: At the very least maybe go through it in your head?
  [15/2/19, 18:40:34] Donovan Sim: I think maybe you might only hv time to give the intention
  [15/2/19, 18:40:59] Donovan Sim: But the idea is that it helps to make sure that everyone is clear about your instructions, your intentions behind those instructions, and your thought process
  [15/2/19, 18:41:10] Donovan Sim: For the senior naval officers they also learn MSAI
  [15/2/19, 18:41:14] Donovan Sim: M stands for mission
  [15/2/19, 18:41:16] Donovan Sim: So for example
  [15/2/19, 18:41:25] Donovan Sim: M- destroy all enemy units in area of ops
  [15/2/19, 18:41:43] Donovan Sim: S enemy units are at [location] and [location]
  [15/2/19, 18:41:50] Donovan Sim: A they are trying to launch pincer attack
  [15/2/19, 18:42:35] Donovan Sim: I proceed to focus fire on [enemy unit A] before focusing fire on [enemy unit B]
  [15/2/19, 18:42:42] Donovan Sim: Yea just use it as you see fit
  [15/2/19, 18:43:03] Donovan Sim: If you want to call to clarify anything can call later tonight
  [15/2/19, 18:43:16] Yi Hein: Yeah sure this seems useful
  [15/2/19, 18:43:38] Yi Hein: In a sense, it's formalised way of doing logical thinking and problem solving
  [15/2/19, 18:44:05] Donovan Sim: Yea but you have to understand that in the navy when they use this, everyone is in the bridge or the CIC together
  [15/2/19, 18:44:12] Donovan Sim: And everyone is sitting at their control station
  [15/2/19, 18:44:21] Donovan Sim: So its not like they running around in the middle of jungle
  [15/2/19, 18:44:23] Donovan Sim: So yea...
  [15/2/19, 18:44:49] Donovan Sim: It did help me perform better in gaming tho lol when i think through this format in my head
  [15/2/19, 18:45:52] Yi Hein: HAHAHAHA I'll try it out!
  [15/3/19, 09:46:52] Yi Hein: Got into OCS hahaha
  [15/3/19, 09:46:58] Yi Hein: Thanks so much for your advice!!!

  [16/7/19, 10:27:38] AJ Loy: The Runaway Company presents Wilderness!
  
  Wilderness follows 6 teenagers who are sent to a wilderness therapy camp, a behavioural counselling programme set in the great outdoors, in a bid to help them recover from their traumas and overcome their struggles
  
  Wilderness is a story about survival, connection and above all, hope. To face our worst fears and overcome them. To allow yourself to heal, no matter what. It's about people who are barely holding on -- and yet find the strength to get through another day.
  
  Wilderness will be performed at the Stamford Arts Centre,
  Fri, 9 - Sun, 11 August 
  Fri & Sat: 7.30pm
  Sat & Sun: 2.30pm

  [17/9/19, 13:57:52] Trina: SMILE N IF U MUST LIE
  [17/9/19, 13:57:55] Trina: LIE CONFIDENTLY
  [17/9/19, 13:58:29] Yi Hein: Hahaha
  [17/9/19, 13:58:52] AJ Loy: NOOOO integrity issue
  [17/9/19, 13:58:57] Yi Hein: OOC
  [17/9/19, 13:59:34] Yi Hein: aj what was your command principle/philosophy as CWC?
  [17/9/19, 13:59:44] AJ Loy: Umbrella leadership
  [17/9/19, 13:59:55] AJ Loy: I open to stop the rain (blame) from hitting those beneath me
  [17/9/19, 14:00:07] AJ Loy: I close to let the sunlight (praise and welfare) shine on those I lead
  [17/9/19, 14:00:22] AJ Loy: Stand with me and cooperate, you will stay dry
  [17/9/19, 14:00:36] AJ Loy: You mess around with me you’ll get wet
  [17/9/19, 14:02:10] AJ Loy: Principles:
  - servant leadership (it is not an entitlement but a privilege to be able to serve by leading - I put my men before myself) how does this materialise? If I need to do more and get less rest so that my men do less and get more rest, I will
  - leadership by example (I will never ask anyone to do anything I am not prepared and capable of doing myself)
  [17/9/19, 14:02:27] Yi Hein: what did you push for as cwc?
  [17/9/19, 14:03:09] AJ Loy: Good administration - admin/bookout time is very precious and very often it comes down to the competency of the CGS
  [17/9/19, 14:03:51] AJ Loy: I always pumped down information quickly so ppl know how much time they have and I will argue (don’t use this word) with Instructors if they’re being unreasonable or if my guys need more time
  [17/9/19, 14:04:28] AJ Loy: Bookout can depend on how much time you allocate to area cleaning/ showering so you have to work out your priorities and find a balance there
  [17/9/19, 14:05:32] AJ Loy: I held back deliberately on canteen breaks and nights out because I thought to push for them at such an early stage would be to cheapen them and thus not have that morale booster as a tool in the arsenal during later stages when we might need them
  [17/9/19, 14:06:48] AJ Loy: Hygiene - I always took a look at the CET ahead of time to find out where the Instructors were being stupid (like allocating 10 mins for the whole wing to shower). Also requesting permission for personal items like shoe racks outside bunk. And permission from wing Comm to leave windows open and fans on to air the rooms
  [17/9/19, 21:41:16] Yi Hein: I’m Cadet Learning lol 😝
  [17/9/19, 21:49:20] Trina: IS THAT GD??
  [17/9/19, 21:49:28] Trina: I ASSUME IT IS! CONGRATSTSTST

  [2/1/20, 20:14:37] Yi Hein: cRiNGe
  [2/1/20, 20:15:30] Yi Hein: esp when the warrant officers who’ve been in service for decades address us as such 🥴
  [2/1/20, 20:15:51] AJ Loy: Yeah
  [2/1/20, 20:16:03] AJ Loy: I had a discussion with my 2WO in 1 GDS about this
  [2/1/20, 20:17:44] AJ Loy: And they explained that they call us “sir” not out of respect for the person - that one has to earn through actions - but out of respect for the rank. If we all try to be causal and ignore the rank we wear then what is the point of command? It’s so that when it’s crunch time and lives are on the line, there is no time or energy wasted deciding who takes orders from whom and who makes the decisions.
  [2/1/20, 20:17:48] AJ Loy: Harsh but true
  [2/1/20, 20:18:35] Yi Hein: Yup agreed
